Man: <i>It's coming from the courtyard.</i>

16

- <i></i>
- Man #2: It's the Lord Commander!

17

Help me get him inside.

Thorne did this.

21

How many of your brothers
do you think you can trust?

22

Trust?

23

The men in this room.

24

Davos:
Does the wolf know you?

25

We need all the help we can get.

26

<i></i>

27

Melisandre:
<i>Ser Davos.</i>

28

<i></i>

29

Melisandre:
<i>I saw him in the flames</i>

30

fighting at Winterfell.

31

I can't speak for the flames...

32

but he's gone.

33



34

Man:
<i>He was our Lord Commander.</i>

35

Man #2:
<i>He never should have been!</i>

36



37

- You all know why you're here.

38

<i></i>

39

Jon Snow is dead.

40

Who killed him?

41

- I did.
- 

42

And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck

43

and the other officers
in this castle.

44

- Murderers!
- Traitors!

45

- <i></i>
- 

46

- You're right!
- 

47

<i>We've committed treason, all of us.</i>

48

Jon Snow was my Lord Commander.

49

I had no love for him.

50

That was no secret.

51

But I never once disobeyed an order.

52

Loyalty is the foundation

53

on which the Night's Watch is built.

54

And the Watch means everything to me.

55

I have given my life,

56

we have all given our lives
to the Night's Watch.

57

Jon Snow was going to
destroy the Night's Watch.

58

<i>He let the wildlings
through our gates</i>

59

as no Lord Commander
has ever done before.

60

He gave them the very land
on which they reaved

61

and raped and murdered.

62

Lord Commander Snow did
what he thought was right,

63

I've no doubt about that.

64

And what he thought was right
would have been the end of us.

65

He thrust a terrible choice upon us.

66

And we made it.

67



68



69

Davos: <i>He'll have
seen we didn't come.</i>

70

Thorne will have
made it official by now.

71

Castle Black is his.

72

I don't care who's sitting
at the high table.

73

Jon was my friend.

74

And those fuckers butchered him.

75

Now we return the favor.

76

We don't have the numbers.

77

- We have a direwolf.
- It's not enough.

78

<i>I didn't know Lord
Commander Snow for long,</i>

79

but I have to believe he wouldn't have
wanted his friends to die for nothing.

80

If you were planning to see tomorrow,
you picked the wrong room.

81

We all die today.

82

I say we do our best to take
Thorne with us when we go.

83

We need to fight,
but we don't need to die.

84

- Not if we have help.
- Who is gonna help us?

85

You're not the only ones who
owe your lives to Jon Snow.

86

Bolt the door.

87

Don't let anyone in.

88

I'll be back as soon as I can.

Ramsay: <i>She was 11 the
first time I saw her.</i>

93

The kennelmaster's daughter.

94

She smelled of dog.

95

I wasn't much older, but everybody
was already afraid of me.

96

You certainly were.

97

Myranda wasn't, though.

98

What could I do to her
that those hounds couldn't?

99

She was fearless.

100

There was nothing she wouldn't do.

101

Your pain will be paid for
a thousand times over.

102

I wish you could be here to watch.

103

Maester: <i>Shall I have a
grave dug for her, my lord?</i>

104

<i>Or would you rather
the men build a pyre?</i>

105

Buried, burned?

106

This is good meat.

107

Feed it to the hounds.

108

Roose: Your command of the
cavalry was impressive.

109

Thanks to you, the false king
Stannis Baratheon is dead.

110

Do you know who struck
the killing blow?

111

- No.
- A shame.

112

I'd reward the man.

113

Still, a great victory.

114

Do you feel like a victor?

115

I rebelled against the crown

116

to arrange your marriage
to Sansa Stark.

117

Do you think that
burning wagons in the night

118

and mowing down tired,
outnumbered Baratheons

119

is the same as facing a prepared
and provisioned Lannister army?

120

No.

121

A reckoning will come.

122

We need the North to face it.

123

The entire North.

124

They won't back us
without Sansa Stark.

125

We no longer have Sansa Stark.

126

You played your games with her.

127

You played your games with the heir to the
Iron Islands and now they're both gone.

128

I have a team of men after them
with some of my best hounds.

129

<i>They won't get far.</i>

130

I'm glad to hear it.

131

Without Sansa, you won't be
able to produce an heir.

132

And without an heir, well...

133

let's hope the maesters are right

134

and Lady Walda's carrying a boy.

135

<i></i>

136

<i></i>

137



138

We can't stop.

139

<i></i>

140

We have to cross here.

141

-  I can't.
- It's the only way to throw off the hounds.

142

But it's too cold. I can't.
I won't make it. I'll die.

143

I've seen what his hounds
do to a person.

144

This way is better.

145

<i></i>

146



147



148



149

Over here.
Come on.

150



151

Sansa.

152

Sansa.

153

<i></i>

154

Man:
<i>Tell them to settle down!</i>

155

Stay here.
I'll lure them away.

156

No, I won't make it without you.

157

You will.

158

Go north, only north.

159

Jon is Lord Commander
at Castle Black.

160

He'll help you.

161

<i></i>

162

<i></i>

163

Man:
See somebody, eh?

164

- Man #2: There they are!
- Man #3: Get them!

165

Where is Lady Bolton?

166

- Dead.
- Liar.

167

Theon: <i>She broke her leg
jumping from the ramparts.</i>

168

I left her to die in the snow.

169



170

Got something!
Run!

171



172

Man:
<i>Hyah!</i>

173

- 
- 

174



175

- Man #2: Resist. Stay.

- Man #2:<i> Stay.</i>

I can't wait to see what parts
Ramsay cuts off you this time.

179

181

182

Man #2:
<i>Rider! Who is it?</i>

183

- It's a bloody woman.

No! Please!

196

198

Lady Sansa, I offer
my services once again.

199

I will shield your back
and keep your counsel

200

and give my life
for yours if need be.

201

I swear it by the old
gods and the new.

202

And I vow...

203

that you shall always
have a place by my hearth

204

<i>and...</i>

205

Meat and mead at my table.

206

...meat and mead
at my table.

207

And I pledge to ask no service of you

208

that might bring you dishonor.

209

<i>I swear it by the old
gods and the new.</i>

210

Arise.

211



212

<i></i>

213

Handmaiden: <i>Your Grace,
I'm sorry to disturb you.</i>

214

A ship from Dorne
has sailed into the harbor.

215

Myrcella.

216

<i></i>

217

<i></i>

218

Do you remember the first
time you saw a dead body?

219

Mother.

220

All I could think about when she died

221

was what would happen to her now.

222

Every day, every night,

223

what does Mama look like now?

224

Has she started to bloat?

225

Has her skin turned black?

226

Have her lips peeled
back from her teeth?

227

I think about locking
Myrcella in a crypt.

228

I think about her beautiful
little face starting to collapse.

229

Shh, shh.
Don't think about it.

230

I have to.

231

I have to. It's not right
she has to suffer alone.

232

She's not suffering.
She's gone.

233

No one can hurt her anymore.

234

She was good.

235

From her first breath,
she was so sweet.

236

I don't know where she came from.

237

She was nothing like me.

238

No meanness, no jealousy, just good.

239

I know.

240

<i>I thought if I could
make something so good,</i>

241

so pure...

242

- maybe I'm not a monster.
- <i>Listen-- listen to me.</i>

243

She was my daughter and I failed her.

244

No, I knew this would happen.

245

The witch told me years ago.

246

She promised me three children
and she promised me they'd die.

247

"And gold their shrouds."

248

Everything she said came true.

249

You couldn't have stopped it.

250

It's prophecy.
It's fate.

251

- You don't believe that.
- Of course I do.

252

You told me yourself
when Father died.

253

You said we had to stay together.

254

You said people would try to
tear us apart, take what's ours.

255

That was a prophecy, too.

256

I didn't listen to you and
everything you said came true.

257

Fuck prophecy.
Fuck fate.

258

Fuck everyone who isn't us.

259

We're the only ones who matter,

260

the only ones in this world.

261

And everything they've taken from us,

262

we're going to take back and more.

263

We're going to take
everything there is.

264

"The Seven Hells brim
with the souls of saintly men.

265

They scream in agony
and their shame is so great,

266

they do not feel the flames,

267

for now they see
if not for a single sin

268

they concealed,
they were saved."

269

I'd like to see my brother.

270

- Confess.
- Please.

271

How is he?
At least tell me that.

272

Confess.

273

I am the queen and I
demand to see my brother.

274

<i>Sinners don't make demands.</i>

275

They make confessions.

276



277

<i></i>

278

Septa Unella.

279

 Our other guests need you.

280

- 
- There.

281

Septa Unella can be
overzealous at times.

282

I'll speak with her.

283

My brother, can you
tell me how he is?

284

It isn't Ser Loras
that brings me here.

285

Your husband misses you dearly.

286

The love between a man
and wife is sacred.

287

It reflects the love
the gods have for all of us.

288

But sin leads us away
from the sacred.

289

And only confession can purge sin.

290

I have nothing to confess.

291

So you believe you are pure?

292

Perfect?

293

Wholly without sin?

294

None of us are.

295

You have started down the path.

296

But you have many miles to go.

297

298

I always envied Oberyn.

299

He lived.

300

He truly lived.

301

Sailed around the world.

302

Fought men from every country.

303

Lay with the most
beautiful women alive.

304

- And men.
- And men.

305

He experienced everything

306

while I sat here in Dorne

307

trying my best to keep my
people alive and well fed.

308

But that is life.

309

We each have our roles.

310

Oberyn was born to be an adventurer.

311

And I was born to rule.

312

The gods are not fools.

313

You would have been
a lousy adventurer.

314

And Oberyn, pfft,

315

he would have been a terrible ruler.

316

Your mother is a brilliant
woman, you know that?

317

Maester:
<i>Prince Doran.</i>

318

The Princess Myrcella.

319



320

When was the last time
you left this palace?

321

You don't know your own people.

322

<i>- Their disgust for you.
- </i>

323

Elia Martell raped and
murdered, and you did nothing.

324

Oberyn Martell butchered,
and you did nothing.

325

You're not a Dornishman.

326

You're not our prince.

327

My son Trystane...

328



329

Your son is weak just like you.

330

And weak men will never
rule Dorne again.

331

I told you I'm not hungry.

332

We're not here to feed you.

333

We're here to kill you.

334

You want her to do it or me?

335

We are family.
I don't want to hurt you.

336

Her or me?

337

You.

338

Good.

339

Smart boy.

340

You're a greedy bitch, you know that?

Tyrion: We're never going to fix

of an 800-foot pyramid.

344

We'll be fine.

345

We're dressed like common merchants.

346

You walk like a rich person.

347

You've spent a lot of time
studying the way rich people walk?

348

You walk as though the paving
stones were your personal property.

349

I used to steal from people
like you when I was a boy.

350

It's a good thing
you're not a boy anymore.

351

Because you have no cock.

- <i>I know what mhysa means.</i>

361

- Varys: Who wrote it?

362

Our queen is not as popular
in Meereen as she used to be.

363

The Sons of the Harpy?

364

Very possibly.

365

Daenerys Targaryen took away
their most valuable property,

366

told them human beings weren't
even property to begin with.

367

You can see why they're unhappy.

368

Of course,

369

it could also be the freed men.

372

Many of the former slaves feel
that Daenerys has abandoned them.

She did fly away on a
dragon and not come back.

It's a problem.

380

Fear has brought Meereen
to a standstill.

381

Whoever you are, wherever you go,

382

someone in this city
wants to murder you.

383

We can't fight
an enemy we don't know.

384

The Sons of the Harpy
planned their attack

385

in the fighting pits very carefully,

386

which means they take
orders from someone.

387

And have you started
looking for that someone?

388

My little birds
have already taken wing.

389

Soon they'll return, singing
songs of men in gold masks.

393

Well, we won't be sailing
to Westeros anytime soon.

394

Goat?

395

Ram.

396

You think our friend got him?

397

Don't know anything else
that can melt a ram's horn.

398

We're on the right path, then.

399

Daario: Perhaps she's
tired of being queen.

400

I don't think she likes it very much.

401

She's too smart to like it.

402

Maybe she's flown somewhere else,

403

somewhere far away from men like us.

404

I've been all over the world.

405

There's no escaping men like us.

406

There's no escaping her, eh?

407

You keep coming back.
Why?

408

You know why.

409

Isn't it frustrating

410

wanting someone
who doesn't want you back?

411

Of course it is.

412

You're a romantic.
I admire that.

413

Sometimes I look at you and I think,

414

"So that's what I'll be like
when I grow old."

415

If you grow old.

416

If I grow old.

417

I hope I do.

418

I want to see what
the world looks like

419

when she's done conquering it.

420

So do I.

421

Daario:
Huh, an army?

422

Not an army.

423

A horde.

424

Dothraki?

425

They have her.

Hear that, lads?
Nothing to fear.

Despite appearances, I think you'll
find the city's on the rise.

3

Perhaps we should take shelter.

4

The city's on the rise?

5

Meereen is strong.

6

Commerce has returned to the markets.

7

The people are behind you.

8

Well, not all the people, of course.

9

No ruler that ever lived had
the support of all the people.

10

But the rebirth of Meereen is
the cause of this violence.

11

The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed.

12

Because if Meereen succeeds,
a city without slavery,

13

a city without Masters...

14

...it proves that no one needs a Master.

15

Good.

16

Shall we begin?

17

Do we have a plan?

18

I will crucify the Masters.

19

I will set their fleets afire,

20

kill every last one of their soldiers,

21

and return their cities to the dirt.

22

That is my plan.

23

You don't approve?

24

You once told me you knew
what your father was.

25

Did you know his plans
for King's Landing

26

when the Lannister armies
were at his gates?

27

Probably not.

28

Well, he told my brother
and Jaime told me.

29

He had caches of wildfire
hidden under the Red Keep,

30

the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor,

31

all the major thoroughfares.

32

He would have burned every
one of his citizens.

33

The loyal ones and the traitors.

34

Every man, woman, and child.

35

That's why Jaime killed him.

36

This is entirely different.

37

You're talking about destroying cities.

38

It's not entirely different.

39

I'd like to suggest an
alternate approach.

40

Once before, I offered you peace.

41

If you had not been so arrogant,

42

you could have returned to your
homeland with a fleet of ships.

43

Instead, you will flee
Slaver's Bay on foot

44

like the beggar queen you are.

45

We are here to discuss
terms of surrender,

46

not to trade insults.

47

The terms are simple.

48

You and your foreign friends will abandon
the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen.

49

The Unsullied you stole
from Kraznys mo Nakloz

50

will remain to be sold again
to the highest bidder.

51

The translator you stole from
Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain

52

to be sold again to the highest bidder.

53

The dragons beneath the Great
Pyramid will be slaughtered.

54

We obviously didn't communicate clearly.

55

We're here to discuss
your surrender, not mine.

56

I imagine it's difficult

57

adjusting to the new reality.

58

Your reign is over.

59

My reign has just begun.

60

Dracarys.

61

Your men have a choice:

62

fight and die for masters who would
never fight and die for you,

63

or go home to your families.

64

Thank you for the armada.

65

Our queen does love ships.

66

Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact.

67

You violated that pact.

68

You declared war upon us.

69

Though our queen does
have a forgiving nature,

70

this cannot be forgiven.

71

Our queen insists that
one of you must die

72

as punishment for your crimes.

73

It always seems a bit
abstract, doesn't it,

74

other people dying?

75

Him. He should die.

76

Yes, him. He's not one of us.

77

He's an outsider, a lowborn.

78

He does not speak for us.

79

Please.

80

Please.

81

Tell your people what happened here.

82

Tell them you live by the
grace of Her Majesty.

83

When they come forward with
notions of retribution

84

or ideas about returning the slave
cities to their former glory,

85

remind them what happened

86

when Daenerys Stormborn and
her dragons came to Meereen.

87

You don't have to be here.

88

Yes, I do.

89

My beloved wife.

90

I've missed you terribly.

91

Thank you for returning
Lady Bolton safely.

92

Now, dismount and kneel before me,

93

surrender your army and proclaim me the true
Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North.

94

I will pardon you for
deserting the Night's Watch.

95

I will pardon these treasonous
lords for betraying my house.

96

Come, bastard,

97

you don't have the men, you
don't have the horses,

98

and you don't have Winterfell.

99

Why lead those poor
souls into slaughter?

100

There's no need for a battle.

101

Get off your horse and kneel.

102

I'm a man of mercy.

103

You're right.

104

There's no need for a battle.

105

Thousands of men don't need to die.

106

Only one of us.

107

Let's end this the old way.

108

You against me.

109

I keep hearing stories
about you, bastard.

110

The way people in the
North talk about you,

111

you're the greatest
swordsman who ever walked.

112

Maybe you are that good.

113

Maybe not.

114

I don't know if I'd beat you.

115

But I know that my army will beat yours.

116

I have 6,000 men.

117

You have, what, half that?

118

Not even?

119

Aye, you have the numbers.

120

Will your men want to fight for you

121

when they hear you
wouldn't fight for them?

122

He's good. Very good.

123

Tell me, will you let
your little brother die

124

because you're too proud to surrender?

125

How do we know you have him?

126

Now, if you want to save...

127

You're going to die
tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

128

Sleep well.

129

She's a fine woman, your sister.

130

I look forward to having
her back in my bed.

131

And you're all fine-looking men.

132

My dogs are desperate to meet you.

133

I haven't fed them for
seven days. They're ravenous.

134

I wonder which parts they'll try first.

135

Your eyes?

136

Your balls?

137

We'll find out soon enough.

138

In the morning, then, bastard.

139

If he was smart, he'd stay inside

140

the walls of Winterfell and wait us out.

141

That's not his way. He knows
the North is watching.

142

If the other houses sense
weakness on his part,

143

they'll stop fearing him.

144

He can't have that. Fear is his power.

145

It's his weakness, too. His men
don't want to fight for him.

146

They're forced to fight for him.
If they feel the tide turning...

147

It's not his men that worry me.

148

It's his horses.

149

I know what mounted
knights can do to us.

150

You and Stannis cut through
us like piss through snow.

151

We're digging trenches
all along our flanks.

152

They won't be able to hit us
the way that Stannis hit you,

153

in a double envelopment.

154

A pincer move.

155

They won't be able to
hit us from the sides.

156

Good.

157

It's crucial that we
let them charge at us.

158

They've got the numbers,
we need the patience.

159

If we let him buckle our
center, he'll pursue.

160

Then we'll have him
surrounded on three sides.

161

Did you really think that cunt
would fight you man-to-man?

162

No.

163

But I wanted to make him angry.

164

I want him coming at us full tilt.

165

We should all get some sleep.

166

Rest, Jon Snow. We need
you sharp tomorrow.

167

So you've met the enemy,

168

drawn up your battle plans.

169

Aye, for what they're worth.

170

You've known him for the space
of a single conversation,

171

you and your trusted advisors,

172

and you sit around making your plans

173

on how to defeat a man you don't know.

174

I lived with him.

175

I know the way his mind works.

176

I know how he likes to hurt people.

177

Did it ever once occur to you
that I might have some insight?

178

You're right.

179

You think he's going to
fall into your trap.

180

He won't. He's the one who lays traps.

181

- He's overconfident.
- He plays with people.

182

He's far better at it than you.
He's been doing it all his life.

183

Aye, and what have I been doing all
my life? Playing with broomsticks?

184

I fought beyond the Wall against
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

185

I've defended the Wall from
worse than Ramsay Bolton.

186

You don't know him.

187

All right, tell me.

188

What should we do? How
do we get Rickon back?

189

We'll never get him back.

190

Rickon is Ned Stark's trueborn son,

191

which makes him a greater
threat to Ramsay

192

than you, a bastard, or me, a girl.

193

As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim
to Winterfell will be contested,

194

which means he won't live long.

195

We can't give up on our brother.

196

Listen to me, please. He
wants you to make a mistake.

197

Of course he does. What
should I do differently?

198

I don't know! I don't know
anything about battles.

199

Just don't do what he wants you to do.

200

Aye, that's good advice.

201

You think that's obvious?

202

Well, it is a bit obvious.

203

If you had asked for my advice earlier,

204

I would have told you not
to attack Winterfell

205

until we had a larger force,
or is that obvious, too?

206

When will we have a larger force?!

207

We've pleaded with every
house that'll have us.

208

The Blackfish can't help us.

209

We're lucky to have this many men.

210

- It's not enough! - No, it's
not enough. It's what we have!

211

Battles have been won
against greater odds.

212

If Ramsay wins,

213

I'm not going back there alive.

214

Do you understand me?

215

I won't let ever let
him touch you again.

216

I'll protect you, I promise.

217

No one can protect me.

218

No one can protect anyone.

219

You think there's hope?

220

I've never seen these
Bolton fuckers fight.

221

And they've never seen
the free folk fight,

222

so, yes, there's hope.

223

You want to avenge your king, don't you?

224

It wasn't the Boltons defeated Stannis.

225

It was Stannis himself.

226

I loved the man.

227

He lifted me up and made me something.

228

But he had demons in his skull
whispering foul things.

229

- You saw these demons?
- What?

230

No, it's a manner of speaking.

231

Not... actual demons.

232

Well, you loved that cunt Stannis

233

and I loved the man he burned.

234

Mance didn't have demons in his skull.

235

He didn't torch people or
listen to some red witch.

236

I believed in him.

237

I thought he was the man to
lead us through the Long Night.

238

But I was wrong just like you.

239

Maybe that was our mistake,
believing in kings.

240

Jon Snow's not a king.

241

No, he's not.

242

I need a good drink to help me
sleep the night before a fight.

243

You want some?

244

I have a jug of sour goat's milk

245

stronger than any of that grape water

246

you southern twats like sucking on.

247

No, thanks. It does sound delicious,

248

but I better keep a clear head.

249

I can never sleep the
night before a battle.

250

So what do you do all night?

251

I walk.

252

Think and walk.

253

Think and walk until I'm
far enough away from camp

254

that no one can hear me
shitting my guts out.

255

Happy shitting.

256

My lady.

257

You weren't at the war council.

258

I'm not a soldier.

259

Any advice?

260

Don't lose.

261

If I do, if I fall...

262

don't bring me back.

263

I'll have to try.

264

I'm ordering you not to bring me back.

265

I am not your servant, Jon Snow.

266

You're in my camp. I'm the commander.

267

I serve the Lord of Light.

268

I do what he commands.

269

How do you know what he commands?

270

I interpret his signs...

271

as well as I can.

272

If the Lord didn't want
me to bring you back,

273

how did I bring you back?

274

I have no power.

275

Only what he gives me
and he gave me you.

276

Why?

277

I don't know.

278

Maybe you're only needed for this small
part of his plan and nothing else.

279

Maybe he brought you here to die again.

280

What kind of god would
do something like that?

281

The one we've got.

282

Game of Thrones 6x09 - The Battle of Bastards.

283

Last time we saw each other
was at Winterfell, yes?

284

You were making jokes about
my height, I seem to recall.

285

Everyone who makes a joke
about a dwarf's height

286

thinks he's the only person ever to
make a joke about a dwarf's height.

287

"The height of nobility,"
"a man of your stature,"

288

"someone to look up to."

289

You're all making the
same five or six jokes.

290

- It was a long time ago.
- It was.

291

And how have things been
going for you since then?

292

Not so well, I gather.

293

Can't imagine you would have murdered the
Stark boys if things had been going well.

294

I didn't murder the Stark boys.

295

But I did things that were
just as bad or worse.

296

And he paid for them.

297

Doesn't seem like it.

298

He's still alive.

299

It was complicated for you, I'm sure,

300

growing up at Winterfell.

301

Never quite knowing who you were.

302

But then, we all live
complicated lives, don't we?

303

You've brought us 100
ships from the Iron Fleet

304

with men to sail them.

305

In return, I expect you
want me to support

306

your claim to the throne
of the Iron Islands?

307

Not my claim. Hers.

308

And what's wrong with you?

309

I'm not fit to rule.

310

We can agree upon that at least.

311

Has the Iron Islands
ever had a queen before?

312

No more than Westeros.

313

Our Uncle Euron returned
home after a long absence.

314

He murdered our father and took
the Salt Throne from Yara.

315

He would have murdered
us if we'd stayed.

316

Lord Tyrion tells me your
father was a terrible king.

317

You and I have that in common.

318

We do.

319

And both murdered by a usurper as well.

320

Will their ships be enough?

321

With the former Masters'
fleet, possibly.

322

Barely.

323

There are more than 100
ships in the Iron Fleet.

324

There are and Euron is building more.

325

He's going to offer them to you.

326

So why shouldn't I wait for him?

327

The Iron Fleet isn't all he's bringing.

328

He also wants to give you...

329

His big cock, I think he said.

330

Euron's offer is also an
offer of marriage, you see.

331

You won't get one without the other.

332

And I imagine your offer is
free of any marriage demands?

333

I never demand, but I'm
up for anything, really.

334

He murdered our father and
would have murdered us.

335

He'll murder you as soon
as you have what he wants.

336

The Seven Kingdoms.

337

All of them.

338

And you don't want the Seven Kingdoms?

339

Your ancestors defeated ours
and took the Iron Islands.

340

We ask you to give them back.

341

And that's all?

342

We'd like you to help us
murder an uncle or two

343

who don't think a woman's fit to rule.

344

Reasonable.

345

What if everyone starts
demanding their independence?

346

She's not demanding, she's asking.

347

The others are free to ask as well.

348

Our fathers were evil
men, all of us here.

349

They left the world worse
than they found it.

350

We're not going to do that.

351

We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

352

You will support my claim as
queen of the Seven Kingdoms

353

and respect the integrity
of the Seven Kingdoms.

354

No more reaving, roving,
raiding, or raping.

355

That's our way of life.

356

No more.

357

No more.

358

Do you like games, little man?

359

Let's play a game.

360

Run to your brother.

361

The sooner you make it to him,

362

the sooner you get to see him again.

363

That's it.

364

That's the game.

365

Easy.

366

Ready?

367

Go.

368

No, you have to run, remember?

369

Those are the rules.

370

`T`U`S`U`B`T`I`T`U`L`O`C`O`M

371

Don't.

372

Prepare to charge.

We may as well be
taking shits back here.

It's time, go.

398

- Who owns the North?
- We do!

399

- Who owns the North?

400

Show me!

401

Hey!

Infantry, advance!

403

With me, lads! Break their line!

404

Help me!

405

- Tormund!
- Get him back!

406

Infantry, advance.

407

Both sides!

408

Fall back!

409

Fall back!

410

Fuck this, come on!

411

We're going home!

412

Open the gate!

413

Archers to the wall.

414

- Their army's gone.
- Our army's gone.

415

We have Winterfell.

416

They don't have the men for a siege.
All we have to do is wait.

417

Archers!

418

To the wall!

419

You suggested one-on-one
combat, didn't you?

420

I've reconsidered.

421

I think that sounds
like a wonderful idea.

422

We're going to bury my
brother in the crypt

423

next to my father.

424

Jon.

425

Where is he?

426

Sansa.

427

Hello, Sansa.

428

Is this where I'll be staying now?

429

No.

430

Our time together is
about to come to an end.

431

That's all right.

432

You can't kill me.

433

I'm part of you now.

434

Your words will disappear.

435

Your house will disappear.

436

Your name will disappear.

437

All memory of you will disappear.

438

My hounds will never harm me.

439

You haven't fed them in seven days.

440

You said it yourself.

441

They're loyal beasts.

442

They were.

443

Now they're starving.

444

Sit.

445

Down.

446

Down!

447

Down! Down!

448

Down!

Lady Crane:
<i>My son.</i>

My firstborn son.

5

My child king, hush.

6

Listen to the gods,
for you they sing.

7

Fight no more, sweet child.

8

Your wars are won.

9

The wolves are buried

10

and the false stag done.

11

Shut your blue eyes, my love.

12

Let the crown fall.

13

The Father above
beckons you to his hall.

14

In Seventh Heaven
I'll see you once more.

15

But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore

16

and my brother the Imp

17

who killed his own king.

18

Born amongst lions,
our curse from within.

19

I will slay him, I swear.

20

With noose or with knife,

21

though it take me a fortnight,

22

a moon or my life.

<i>No worse child

You're good at that.

40

Where did you learn?

41

I'm a jealous woman.

42

I've always liked bad men

43

and they've always liked me.

44

They'd come home wherever
home was that night

45

stinking of some whore's perfume.

46

So we'd fight and I'd
put a hole in them.

47

And then I'd feel terrible,

48

so I'd patch them up.

49

<i>I got good at patching them up.</i>

50

And good at putting holes in them.

51


And that.

52

What happened to the actress?

53

<i>The one who wanted you dead.</i>

54

Bianca.

55

She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress

56

after what I did to her face.

57



58

Mmm.

59

I never did learn to cook.

60

But eat.
Eat. You need it.

61

The company is moving
on to Pentos soon.

62

You should come with us.

63

- I can't.
- Why not?

64

Got a feeling you'd be
good at this sort of work.

65

And besides, we need a new actress.

66

I don't think I could
remember all of the lines.

67

Come with us.

68

What's left for you here?

69

You wouldn't be safe.

70

Not while she's looking for me.

71

<i>Who?</i>

72

She doesn't have a name.

73

Where will you go?

74

Essos is east and Westeros is west.

75

But what's west of Westeros?

76

I don't know.

77

Nobody does.

78

<i>That's where all the maps stop.</i>

79

The edge of the world, maybe.

80

<i>I'd like to see that.</i>

81



82

- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.

83

I don't want any.

84

Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

85

Trust me, if my soup didn't
kill you, nothing will.

Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

89

I was a famous kisser.

90

You lads know how to kiss proper?

91

Course we do.

92

This is for masters, this technique.

93

- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

94

He says he's ready.

95

All right.
Now, pay attention.

96

You put your left hand on the
back of the lady's head.

97

Your right hand holds the small
of the lady's back like so.

98

Very romantic.

99

Take your middle finger, yeah,

100

and you jam it right up her bunghole.

101



102

<i>So fucking close!</i>

103

Ah, it smells like pussy to me.

104

Look at him.
You get hard, boy?

105

Fuck you!
Disgusting old twats.

106



107

Got off on that,
did you, you old fuck?

Where's the other one?

114

- The one with the yellow cloak.
- Fuck you!

115

Those are your last words, fuck you?

116

Come on, you can do better.

117

I'd call that a successful gambit.

128

- Would you?
- Look around.

129

The city has come back to life.

130

- You made a pact with fanatics.

If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.

That doesn't mean

Spoken like a man who has

I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

We need friends in Westeros.

139

And we need ships.

140

Most of all, we need our queen.

141

She'll come back.
She has to.

142

My heart's been broken
too many times already.

143

I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

144

I can't go off on a secret mission

151

Have been permitted?

152

That's rather a tortured
way of putting it.

153

They demand to see you, Your Grace.

154

Who permitted them
inside the Red Keep?

155

The king is aware of their presence?

156

<i>He is, Your Grace.</i>

157

He's currently in his
chambers at prayer.

158

Your Grace, His Holiness
the High Septon

159

wishes to speak with you at
the Great Sept of Baelor.

160

His Holiness the High Septon

161

is welcome to see me
here in the Red Keep.

162

Your Grace, this is not a request.

163

It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

164

You are asking me for
something, I'm refusing.

165

The High Septon commands you.

166

<i>Are you sure you want to refuse him?</i>

167

He promised me I could stay in
the Red Keep until my trial.

168

He made no such promises.

169

If you refuse to come of your
own free will--

170

Get out.

171

Move aside, ser.

172



173

Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.

174

I choose violence.

175



176



177



178



179

Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

180



181

Looks like a siege, my lady.

182

You have a keen military mind, Pod.

183

My lady.
My lady.

184

Who goes there?!

185

State your business!

186

My name is Brienne of Tarth.

187

Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

188

Tell him I have his sword.

189

<i></i>

190



191

Getting a bit old
to be a squire, aren't we?

192



193



194

Podrick fucking Payne.

195

I thought you'd be dead by now.

196

Not yet.

197



198

- Are they in there?
- Uh-huh.

199

You think they're fucking?

200

What?

201

No.

202

Why not?
I'd fuck her.

203

You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?

204

- I'm her squire.
- Oh.

205

 Well, he'd
fuck her, that's for sure.

206

And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

207

The way she looks at him.

208

The way all women look at
him is frankly irritating.

209

I preferred working with the
little brother on that account.

210

Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.

211

You must have shown it to her by now.

212

- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?

213

Oh. - An hour in the morning,
an hour at night.

214

Every day.

215

Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

216

Well, that's a different
sort of fighting.

217

Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

218

<i>You want to learn
that sort of fighting?</i>

219

All right.

220

All right, let's start
with your footwork.

221

Show me your stance.

222

Now listen to me, Pod.

223

See how your feet
are about a yard apart?

224

Lesson number one, assume
everyone wants to hit you.

225

'Cause they do, Pod. Everyone
wants to hit a fucking squire.

226

Do it again.
Come on, don't sulk.

227

Jaime: <i>I never thought
you'd find her.</i>

228

<i>I just assumed Sansa was dead.</i>

229

Why would you assume that?

230

In my experience, girls like
her don't live very long.

231

I don't think you know
many girls like her.

232

Well, I'm proud of you.

233

<i>I am. You fulfilled your
oath to Catelyn Stark</i>

234

<i>against all odds.</i>

235

Of course, my sister
wants Sansa dead.

236

The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

237

so there is that complication.

238

What the hell are you doing here?

239

I've come for the Blackfish.

240

You're welcome to have him.

241

Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

242

and assume her rightful
position as Lady of Winterfell.

243

With what army does she
plan on taking Winterfell?

244

The Tully army.

245

They're a bit occupied at the moment.

246

I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun

247

currently defended
by the Tully rebels,

248

so you can see the conundrum.

249

The Tullys are rebels because
they're fighting for their home?

250

Riverrun was granted to
the Freys by royal decree.

251

As a reward for betraying Robb
Stark and slaughtering his family.

252

Exactly.

253

We shouldn't argue about politics.

254

You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

255

I know there is honor in you.

256

- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

257

Don't ask me to betray my own house.

258

I do no such thing.

259

Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

260

Ride south again with your mission
complete and your army intact.

261

What do you propose?

262

Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

263

Let me try to persuade the
Blackfish to give up the castle.

264

Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

265

Because you'll allow him to lead
the Tully forces safely north.

266

Have you ever met the Blackfish?

267

- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

268

All right.

269

Try to talk some sense
into the old goat.

270

He won't listen, but his men might.

271

Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

272

I need your word.

273

If I persuade him
to abandon the castle,

274

you'll grant a safe passage north.

275

You have my word.

276

You have until nightfall.

277



278

You gave it to me for a purpose.

279

I've achieved that purpose.

280

It's yours.

281

It will always be yours.

282

One last thing, Ser Jaime.

283

Yes, Lady Brienne?

284

Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

285

and if you attack the castle,

286

honor compels me
to fight for Sansa's kin.

287

Of course it does.

288

To fight you.

289

Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

290

Blackfish: <i>I've said no
three times already.</i>

291

I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark.

292

I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

293

I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

294

And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

295

The Kingslayer wants to try us.

296

I can feel it.

297

As I have said,
my name is--

298

Yes, Brienne of Tarth.
I know your father.

299

- Good man.
- He always spoke highly of you.

300

And if he were here now, I'd tell
him the same I'm telling you.

301

If you think I'm abandoning
my family's seat

302

on the Kingslayer's word of
honor, you're a bloody fool.

303

Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.

304

We can stand longer than your
one-handed friend thinks we can.

305

- He's not my friend.
- No?

306

Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?

307

Who gave you that sword with
the gold lion on the pommel?

308

Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

309

He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

310

He gave me this sword to protect her.

311

That is what I have done
and I will continue to do

312

until the day I die.

313



314

She's exactly like her mother.

315

I don't have enough men to
help her take Winterfell.

316

You have more than she does.

317

She wants her home back.
I understand that.

318

But this is my home.

319

And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

320

he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

321

Find the maester.

322

We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.

323

What should I write?

324

Tell her I failed.

325



326

There's to be a royal announcement?

327

There is.

328

Why wasn't I informed?

329

There is to be a royal announcement

330

in the throne room

331

at this very moment.

332

Where are you going?

333

To stand by my son.

334

Your place is in the gallery

335

with the other ladies of the court.

336

Pycelle:
<i>Your Grace...</i>

337

Tommen:
<i>Lords and ladies,</i>

338

the Faith and the Crown

339

are the two pillars
that hold up this world.

340

One collapses, so does the other.

341

The Father judges us all.

342

If you break his laws...

343

<i>you will be punished.</i>

344

After conferring with His
Holiness the High Septon,

345

we have determined that Loras Tyrell

346

and Cersei Lannister's trial

347

<i>will be held in
the Great Sept of Baelor</i>

348

<i>on the first day of the
Festival of the Mother.</i>

349



350

Furthermore, after much prayer

351

<i>and reflection,</i>

352

the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

353

trial by combat will be forbidden

354

throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

355

<i></i>

356

Tommen: <i>The tradition
is a brutish one,</i>

357

<i>a scheme devised by corrupt rulers</i>

358

<i>in order to avoid
true judgment from the gods.</i>

359

<i>Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell</i>

360

will stand trial before seven septons

361

as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.

362

<i>Seven blessings to all.</i>

363

Crowd:
<i>Seven blessings.</i>

364

<i></i>

365

Your Grace...

366

that old rumor you told me about.

367

My little birds investigated.

368

And?

369

Was it just a rumor
or something more?

370

More.

371

Much more.

372

Missandei:
<i>You seem happy.</i>

373

I am happy.

374

You should both be happy as well.

375

Not so long ago, this city
was ready to devour itself.

376

Now it's like a man reborn.

377

I will be happy
when our queen returns.

378

Why don't you drink? Why don't
either of you ever drink?

379

Unsullied never drink.

380

- Why not?
- Rules.

381

And who made these rules?

382

Your former masters?

383

<i>Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.</i>

384

Have a drink with me.

385

And you?
What's your excuse?

386

I have tried wine before.

387

It made me feel funny.

388

That's how you know it's working.

389

Here's to our queen.

390

Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

391

To Daenerys Stormborn,
Mother of Dragons,

392

Breaker of Chains,
long may she reign.

393

- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

394

Tyrion:
<i>Do you like it?</i>

395

Tastes like it has turned.

396

Yes, yes.
Fermentation.

397

One day, after our queen has
taken the Seven Kingdoms...

398

I'd like to have my own vineyard.

399

Make my own wine.

400

The Imp's Delight.

401

Only my close friends could drink it.

402

Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

403

I do not know any jokes.

404

Grey Worm?

405

Right.

406

Three lords
walk into a tavern--

407

a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.

408

<i>They order ale,</i>

409

but when the barkeep
brings them over,

410

each of them finds a fly in his cup.

411

The Lannister, outraged, shoves the
cup aside and demands another.

412

The Martell plucks the fly
out and swallows it whole.

413

The Stark reaches into his cup,

414

pulls out the fly and shouts,

415

"Spit it out, you wee shit.

416

Spit it out."

417

It's funnier in Westeros.

418

The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

419

Yes.

420

A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho.

421

Not a true story, necessarily.

422

A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

423

<i>Not at the moment, perhaps.</i>

424

<i>Missandei, do you like the wine?</i>

425

I do.

426

Tell a joke.

427

Two translators
are on a sinking ship.

428

The first says,

429

"Do you know
how to swim?"

430

The second says, "No, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages."

431

Ah!


432

That is the worst joke I ever heard.

433

You don't even know what a joke is.

434

I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

435

You lied to us.

436

I make joke.

437



438

More jokes.

439

I once walked into a brothel

440

with a honeycomb and a jackass.

441

- The madam says--
- <i></i>

442



443

<i></i>

444

The Masters have come
for their property.

445



446

Lord Edmure.

447

<i>I apologize for the way
the Freys treated you.</i>

448

A man of your birth deserves better.

449

You have my word you'll be properly
fed and clothed from now on.

450

I have your word?

451



452

Oh, good.

453

Good, that's--

454

that's a fine thing.

455

My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

456

Whatever game you're playing.

457

The Blackfish is an old man.

458

A good death is all he can hope for.

459

But you, you have a
child now, I've heard.

460

A son you sired
on your wedding night.

461

You're a potent man.

462

A son I've never met

463

born of a wife that I haven't seen

464

since our first night together.

465

You should be with them both.

466

I can arrange that, you realize?

467

Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.

468

A tutor for your boy, knights to
train him to fight and to ride.

469

And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

470

Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?

471

Is that it?

472

After you've massacred my family.

473

Kept me in a cell for years.

474

Stolen our lands.

475

I'll remind you that
our houses are at war.

476

I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

477

but rebelling against the
Crown does have consequences.

478

Says the man who shoved his
sword through his king's back.

479

Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

480

It's not.

481

You understand. On some
level you understand

482

that you're an evil man.

483

I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

484

Well, that is convenient for you.

485

You're a fine-looking
fellow, aren't you?

486

<i></i>

487

Your square jaw,

488

your golden armor.

489

Tell me, I want to know.

490

I truly do.

491

How do you live with yourself?

492

All of us have to believe

493

that we're decent, don't we?

494

You have to sleep at night.

495

How do you tell yourself

496

that you're decent

497

after everything that you've done?

498

I was your sister's prisoner once.

499

She hit me on the head with a
rock if I remember correctly.

500



501

Yeah.

502

She should have killed you.

503

Perhaps, but she didn't.

504

Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

505

<i>But I didn't hate her.</i>

506

I admired her.

507

Far more than her husband or her son.

508

Do you think I care whom you
admire and whom you don't?

509

No, I don't, but I'm telling you
anyway because you're my prisoner.

510

You don't have a choice.

511

The love she had for her children,

512

I was a little awed by it.

513

Reminded me of my sister.

514

Oh.
Oh, I see.

515

You're a madman.

516

I'm not here to trade insults.

517

- Your sister was a strong--
- Don't talk about Cat!

518

- I'll talk about whomever I want.
- 

519

She loved her children.

520

I suppose all mothers do,

521

but Catelyn and Cersei,

522

there's a fierceness
you don't often see.

523

They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

524

Start a war.

525

Burn cities to ash.
Free their worst enemies.

526

The things we do for love.

527

You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

528

That's exactly why I came here.

529

I love Cersei.

530

You can laugh at that if you want.

531

You can sneer.
Doesn't matter.

532

She needs me.

533

And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

534

I'll send for your baby boy.

535

And I'll launch him into
Riverrun with a catapult.

536

Because you don't matter
to me, Lord Edmure.

537

Your son doesn't matter to me.

538

The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

539

Only Cersei.

540

And if I have to
slaughter every Tully

541

who ever lived to get back to her,

542

that's what I'll do.

543

Guard:
<i>Who goes there?</i>

544

Edmure Tully,

545

son of Hoster Tully

546

and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

547

I demand entry.

548

Don't let him in.

549

He's the Lord of Riverrun.

550

I have to obey his commands.

551

He's been their captive

552

ever since they murdered
his king at the Red Wedding.

553

Why do you think the people who
murdered his king at the Red Wedding

554

would decide to let him come home?

555

Because it's a trap, you idiot.

556

Don't let him in.

557

He's my lord, my lord.

558

I've sworn to serve the Lord of
Riverrun and obey his commands.

559

You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

560

You're obeying the fucking
Kingslayer's commands.

561

Edmure:
<i>I demand entry.</i>

562

My lord has given an order.

563

With a knife to his throat.

564

That is not a valid order.

565

Lower the drawbridge and
open the gate for Lord Ed--

566

Man:
Aye, ser.

567

I'll have your head before
I surrender Riverrun.

568

You are not lord
of this castle, my lord.

569

- Lower the drawbridge.
- Man #2:<i> Aye, ser!</i>

570

Black Walder:
<i>If you're wrong,</i>

571

we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

572

Welcome home, my lord.

573

Command all the forces within the
castle to lay down their arms.

574

Open the gates.

575

- My lord--
- Your lord has given a command.

576

<i></i>

577

Man:
<i>Infantry, advance!</i>

578

Find the Blackfish.

579

Put him in irons and hand
him over to the Freys.

580

Find him.

581

Go on.

582

Come with us.

583

I've run before from the Red Wedding.

584

I'm not running again.
This is my family home.

585

Your family is in the North.
Come with us.

586

Don't die for pride when you
can fight for your blood.

587

You'll serve Sansa far
better than I ever could.

588

Guard:
<i>All the way down!</i>

589

- <i>Check that out!</i>
- Go on, now.

590

I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

591

I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.

592

<i></i>

593

We found the Blackfish, my lord.

594

Good.

595

Bring him to me.

596

He died fighting, my lord.

597



598

- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

599

The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.

600

If the slavers' forces--

601

No more talking from you.
Your talking gave us this.

602

And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying--

603

You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.

604

<i>You do not know
what the army should do.</i>

605

All right, what should the army do?

606

We'll not go to the beach.

607

If we go to the beach, the
Masters will take the pyramid.

608

The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.

609

- We stay here.
- And then?

610

We wait for them to come to us.

611

Then we fight them.

612

<i></i>

613

<i></i>

614



615

<i>- 
- </i>

616

Clegane.

617

What the fuck you doing here?

618

Chasing them.
You?

619

Hanging them.

620

Any particular reason?

621

They're our men.
Or they were.

622

They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.

623

<i>Why do you want them?</i>

624

Same reason.

625

I was helping build it.

626

<i>They killed a friend of mine.</i>

627

You've got friends?

628

Not anymore.
They're mine.

629

It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

630

Fuck your name.
They're mine.

631

I killed you once before, Dondarrion.

632

Happy to do it again.

633

Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

634

Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.

635

You can have one of them.

636

Two.

637

No, no, no.

638

We're not butchers.
We hang them.

639

Hanging?

640

All over in an instant.

641

Where's the punishment in that?

642

- They die.
- We all bloody die.

643

Except this one here.

644

I'll only gut one of them.

645

Beric:
<i>No.</i>

646

I'll chop off one hand.

647

We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

648

That's generous.

649

Bunch of nancies.

650

There was a time I would
have killed all seven of you

651

just to gut these three.

652

You're getting old, Clegane.

653

He's not.

654



655

Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

656



657



658



659

Got anything to eat?

660

<i></i>

661

Enjoying yourself?

662

I prefer chicken.

663

You ought to join us.
We could use you.

664

I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.

665

Clegane, we're here for a reason.

666

The Lord of Light is keeping
Beric alive for a reason.

667

He gave a failed, drunk priest

668

the power to bring him
back for a reason.

669

We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

670

Lots of horrible shit
in this world gets done

671

for something larger than ourselves.

672

Cold winds are rising in the North.

673

And you're going to go stop them?

674

We need good men to help us.

675

Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

676

Beric:
<i>True enough.</i>

677

But the Lord of Light gave
you the power to defeat me.

678

- Why?
- 

679

I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.

680

I was better than you before you
started yammering on about the Lord

681

and I'm better than you now.

682

Aye, you're probably right.

683

You're a fighter.

684

You were born a fighter.

685

You walked away from the fight.

686

How did that go?

687

Good and bad, young and old,

688

the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

689

<i>You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.</i>

690

It's not too late for you.

691

<i></i>

692



693

<i>- 
- </i>

694

Lady Crane?

695



696

<i>Lady Crane?</i>

697

If you'd have done your job, she
would have died painlessly.

698

Instead...

699

The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

700

He must always receive what is his.

701

You can't change that.

702

I can't change that.

703

No one can.

704

And now he's been
promised another name.

705



706

- Hey!
- Get out!

707

- Yah!
- 

708

- 
- 

709



710

- 
- 

711

Hey!

712

- Yah!
- 

713

Ah!

714



715



716



717

Woman:
My basket!

718



719



720



721



722

It will all be over soon.

723

On your knees or on your feet?

724



725

Haven't we been through this already?

726

That won't help you.

727

You told her to kill me.

728

Yes.

729

<i>But here you are.</i>

730

And there she is.

731

Finally a girl is no one.

732

A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell

733

and I'm going home.

Burn them all!

3

Where's my sister?

4

Burn them all!

5

Please.

6

Burn them. Burn them all!

7

Burn them all!

8

Meera.

9

They found us.

10

I'm so sorry.

11

Come with me, now.

12

The dead don't rest.

13

It's so green.

14

Oh, yes.

15

Once you get south of the Riverlands,

16

very different sorts of
trees start to take over.

17

Maple, elm, beech, poplar.

18

The odd willow.

19

And of course now that summer's over,

20

you'll start seeing the
autumn colors coming in.

21

Still, you'll find more green
here than anywhere else.

22

You're nervous. You're a nervous talker.

23

That's not any better
being a nervous mute.

24

I didn't think I'd ever come back here

25

after my father made
me renounce my title and inheritance

26

and, well, threaten to
kill me if I didn't.

27

A person just doesn't feel
welcome at that point.

28

And I certainly didn't expect to
be introducing him to my family.

29

So you know what to tell them.

30

That Little Sam is your baby.

31

Yes, now that's very important.

32

If he thinks that Little Sam is
his grandchild, he'll take you in.

33

He'll get an education.
He'll learn to read.

34

And you can help teach him. Huh?

35

What did you tell your family about me?

36

I told them I met you in the North.

37

Did you tell them how far north?

38

Well, it wasn't a very
large piece of parchment.

39

You didn't tell them
where I'm really from?

40

You didn't tell them I'm a wildling?

41

The thing is...

42

my father doesn't like wildlings.

43

He hoped I'd make a man of myself
by "killing some bloody wildlings,"

44

so it's probably a good subject
to avoid if at all possible.

45

I... think we're here.

46

Sam.

47

Oh, Sam.

48

Oh, hello, Mother.

49

I never thought I'd see you again.

50

You look wonderful.

51

Talla?

52

Gods, you're a woman now.

53

Father says I have to
marry Symun Fossoway.

54

- He has yellow teeth...
- That's enough, Talla.

55

Oh... Mother, this is Gilly.

56

Oh, my.

57

You are lovely.

58

I am happy to know you, Lady Tarly.

59

Oh, and this,

60

this is our son Samwell.

61

Hello, little one.

62

It's me, your grandmother.

63

May I hold him?

64

Yes, of course.

65

You have a curious mind, I can tell.

66

You'll be a scholar like your father.

67

Where is Father?

68

And Dickon?

69

They're on a hunt.

70

They'll join us for dinner.

71

Come inside. Such a journey.

72

You must be exhausted.

73

Come, you'll be wanting a
bath after all that travel.

74

Oh, and a dress for dinner.

75

You can wear one of mine.

76

What's... what's your color?

77

Midnight blue or silver?

78

Silver, maybe. Come.

79

You can choose one of my
bedrooms if you want.

80

Is there no other way?

81

You're afraid for her?

82

Of course I'm afraid for her!

83

It just seems very dangerous.

84

She'll be protected the entire way.

85

The Faith Militant are very stern

86

with those who overstep their bounds.

87

And Queen Margaery isn't your mother.

88

I suspect the gods will
predispose the common people

89

to gentleness on her behalf.

90

She's truly opened her heart to them.

91

She's always been very devoted
to the poor and the unfortunate.

92

And now she's devoted
to the gods as well.

93

Would you like to see her?

94

Have they hurt you?

95

Have they mistreated you?

96

- No, Your Grace.
- I've missed you.

97

More than you could know.

98

We'll be together again soon

99

and everything will be
better than it was before.

100

Better how?

101

Soon the...

102

walk of atonement.

103

He says there's no other way.

104

Have you spoken to him at
all, the High Sparrow?

105

Yes, a few times.

106

Have you?

107

Yes, I have.

108

He's not quite what we
thought he was, is he?

109

You think I'm mad.

110

I sound mad.

111

No. No, you don't.

112

You... you could never.

113

You're right, he's not.

114

He's a lot more...

115

He is.

116

There's something about him.

117

His way of looking at the world.

118

It's not an easy thing admitting
to yourself what you really are.

119

It's taken me a while.

120

He's helped me.

121

What are you talking about?

122

You're a good person. You've
always been a good person.

123

You're the best person I know.

124

I was just telling him about
your devotion to the poor.

125

Ah, yes, I visited their hovels

126

and I fed them soup and I made
sure I was seen doing it.

127

I never gave them what they
really needed, though.

128

I've had lots of time to think about
how good I was at seeming good.

129

All those stories I told
myself about who I was

130

and why I did the things I did.

131

There were so many
lies in those stories.

132

I don't understand.

133

It's all right. It really is.

134

It's such a relief to
let go of those lies.

135

What about Loras?

136

I love my brother.

137

I will always love my brother.

138

His soul is pure and perfect.

139

His sins don't erase that purity,

140

they only obscure it.

141

He just needs... to atone for them.

142

We all do.

143

Sooner or later, one way or another.

144

The gods have a plan for us all.

145

It's hard to walk in this.

146

It's beautiful.

147

You're beautiful.

148

This venison, it's very tasty.

149

Is it from today's hunt?

150

Well, no.

151

We haven't been able
to cure that one yet.

152

This is last week's.

153

Oh, of course. Sorry.

154

Long journey.

155

Brought it down from 70 yards.

156

One shot.

157

Oh, that's... that's a fair distance.

158

So do you do much
hunting up at the Wall?

159

Oh, yes. Yes.

160

A good amount.

161

North of the Wall,

162

you don't hunt, you don't eat.

163

Mostly deer or is it elk as well?

164

Rabbits.

165

Sometimes squirrels.

166

I say "we," it's my friend Jon mostly.

167

Sometimes Edd.

168

Oh, and Gilly.

169

She's... she's quite a
good hunter as well.

170

Huntress.

171

I imagine it's common where you're from.

172

We once met a man, Lord Umber from
Last Hearth, wasn't it, Randyll,

173

who said he taught all his
daughters how to hunt.

174

Your father taught you to hunt?

175

Our father would never teach us.

176

I think our father could learn a
thing or two from your father.

177

That's enough of that.

178

Samwell, would you care for more bread?

179

Oh, yes. Yes, please.

180

Thank you, Mother.

181

Not fat enough already?

182

I travelled south under orders
from the Lord Commander.

183

- He wants me to...
- I read your letter.

184

You're to be a maester.

185

Yes.

186

And once I have my chain,

187

I'll return to Castle Black.

188

I thought the Night's Watch
might make a man of you.

189

Something resembling a man at least.

190

You managed to stay soft and fat.

191

Your nose buried in books.

192

Spending your life reading about
the achievements of better men.

193

I'll wager you still can't sit
a horse or wield a sword.

194

Randyll, to be maester of the
Night's Watch is a great honor.

195

He can wield a sword.

196

He killed a Thenn.

197

He killed a white walker.

198

There's no such thing.

199

I saw it with my own eyes on
our way down to Castle Black.

200

He drove a dagger into
the walker's heart.

201

He risked his own life to
save mine more than once.

202

He's a greater warrior than
either of you will ever be.

203

Your way down to Castle Black?

204

Where did he kill a white walker?

205

Where are you from?

206

How'd you come to meet my son?

207

The Night's Watch came to our keep.

208

- Where?
- Gilly.

209

- North of the Wall.
- North of the Wall?

210

You're a wildling.

211

The Seven Kingdoms have waged war
against these savages for centuries

212

and here I sit hosting one in my hall

213

thanks to my son.

214

See that sword?

215

It's called Heartsbane.

216

It's been in our family for 500 years.

217

It's Valyrian steel.

218

Only a handful of them
left in the world.

219

It's supposed to go to my
firstborn son after I die.

220

To him.

221

He will never wield that sword.

222

If he were to become
Lord Tarly of Horn Hill,

223

it would be the end of this house.

224

I took you for a Mole's
Town whore when I saw you

225

and I made my peace with that.

226

Who else would have him?

227

But I overestimated him.

228

No.

229

It was a wildling whore
that seduced my son.

230

This you getting back at me, boy?

231

Bringing that to my table
and making me dine with it?

232

And you got what you
were after, didn't you?

233

A bastard. A half-breed bastard.

234

Your invitation into our home.

235

Come, my dear. Talla.

236

I've lost my appetite.

237

He dishonors us.

238

You dishonor yourself.

239

Your mother's a fine woman.
You're not worthy of her.

240

To please her, I'll take the wildling
in. She can work in the kitchens.

241

The bastard will be raised here.

242

But this will be the last night
you ever spend at Horn Hill.

243

I'm sorry I let him treat you that way.

244

I was afraid he'd turn
you and Little Sam away.

245

I'm not angry at you.

246

I'm angry that horrible people

247

can treat good people that
way and get away with it.

248

When do you have to go?

249

First light.

250

Say good-bye to him for me.

251

You're not what he thinks you are, Sam.

252

He doesn't know what you are.

253

Good-bye, Gilly.

254

- Sam?
- We're leaving.

255

- What?
- Get your things.

256

I don't have any things.

257

- What are you doing?
- We belong together.

258

All of us.

259

What about your mother and sister?

260

Oh, they'll understand.

261

Your sister's dress.

262

She won't mind.

263

Looks better on you anyway.

264

Sam.

265

That's your father's sword.

266

It's my family's sword.

267

Sam.

268

Won't he come for it?

269

He can bloody well try.

270

The lion and the rose are one.

271

I thank the gods above.

272

And to you, my beauteous bride,

273

I pledge undying love.

274

Hail King Joffrey. Hail Queen Margaery.

275

I'll drink a toast to my new queen,

276

for there is no one fairer.

277

Dear Uncle, will you share my
joy and be my royal cupbearer?

278

Drink long and deep, my noble king,

279

from this cup of sweet wine.

280

The last drink he shall ever take.

281

And vengeance shall be mine.

282

Poison!

283

Murder!

284

I gasp. I... I die.

285

I limp.

286

And it was he...

287

...that poisoned me.

288

My evil Uncle Imp.

289

Calm down, dear.

290

My firstborn son.

291

My golden lion

292

foully, falsely slain.

293

I pray you found a lasting peace

294

free from strife and pain.

295

Hear my prayer, O cruel gods.

296

Take my life instead.

297

For I cannot face another day
when my sweet boy is dead.

298

Oh, woe.

299

Oh, grief.

300

Oh, darkest day, my heart
is full of sorrow.

301

All hope is lost.

302

All joy is gone.

303

And there is no tomorrow.

304

What is that I hear and smell?

305

Someone I'll soon send to hell.

306

It's time to see if truth they told

307

who said Tywin Lannister shits gold.

308

You beast. You beast.

309

You killed my wife and now
you've taken your father's life.

310

No worse child ever stained this land.

311

Curse the day I named you.

312

My greatest crime. Now I must flee.

313

Then sail across the Narrow Sea

314

to do unto you more treachery.

315

Don't fear winter. Fear me!

316

Thank you.

317

Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Bianca,

318

Clarenzo.

319

I give you Bobono.

320

I give you Camello.

321

And last but not least,

322

sweet Lady Crane.

323

::T::U::S::U::B::T::I::T::U::L::O::C::O::M::

324

Give this a good beating. Shake
those fleas out. That's a dear.

325

That crowd was shit.

326

Girl.

327

What are you doing back here?

328

Nothing.

329

I saw you the other day in the audience.

330

How many times have you
seen this stupid play?

331

Three times.

332

Did you pay?

333

No.

334

I remember when the players
came to my village.

335

I didn't have any money, so I snuck in.

336

Just like you.

337

Saw the painted faces, the costumes,

338

listened to the songs,

339

cried when the young lovers
died in each other's arms.

340

I ran off and joined them the
next day, never looked back.

341

You're very good.

342

My final speech is shit.

343

But to be fair to myself,
which I always like to be,

344

the writing's no good.

345

So change it.

346

It would all just be farting,
belching, and slapping without you.

347

How would you change it?

348

The queen loves her son
more than anything.

349

And he was taken from her
before she could say good-bye.

350

She wouldn't just cry.

351

She would be angry.

352

She would want to kill the
person who did this to her.

353

What's your name?

354

Mercy.

355

You have very expressive eyes, Mercy.

356

Wonderful eyebrows.

357

Do you like pretending
to be other people?

358

I have to go. My
father's waiting for me.

359

Lady Crane, they loved you.

360

They were sweet. Or drunk.

361

Drunkenly sweet.

362

No laugh for Ned's death.

363

These people are worse than animals.

364

But they loved her. They all love her.

365

Yes, you are adored by
people and animals alike.

366

I do what I can with what I'm given.

367

With what you're given?

368

Well, I was thinking...

369

Oh, we're all thinkers now, are we?

370

Full to the tits with ideas.

371

- I didn't mean...
- You have ideas, I have ideas,

372

he has ideas.

373

Why should my ideas have
any more value than yours

374

simply because I've been
doing this my whole life?

375

Who is anyone to judge my work?

376

This is my profession.
I know what I'm doing.

377

You have no right to an opinion.

378

Careful of that one.

379

She wants you dead.

380

And?

381

As I expected.

382

A shame.

383

A girl had many gifts.

384

You promised me.

385

Don't let her suffer.

386

""T"U"S"U"B"T"I"T"U"L"O"C"O'M"

387

Company, halt!

388

My lord.

389

My lord.

390

My friends, the hour has come.

391

Madness has overtaken this city

392

and grasped in its claws my children.

393

But now we must drive it back

394

under the rocks whence it came.

395

Madness has had its day!

396

Forward, march!

397

Rich or poor, noble or common,

398

if we sin, we must atone.

399

Margaery of House Tyrell

400

came to us a sinner.

401

She stood before the gods
in the holy sept and lied.

402

She turned a blind eye
to her brother's sins.

403

She disgraced her house,

404

her king, and herself.

405

Company, halt!

406

Face front!

407

Turn!

408

Lord Tyrell.

409

Ser Jaime.

410

Sorry to interrupt.

411

We're here for Queen Margaery
and Ser Loras Tyrell.

412

Give them to us and we'll be on our way.

413

I don't have the authority
to give them to you.

414

And you don't have the
authority to take them.

415

That's right.

416

Lock spears!

417

I speak for King Tommen of House
Baratheon, First of His Name.

418

The gods don't recognize his
authority in this matter.

419

You've already insulted one great house.

420

It won't happen twice.

421

Every last sparrow will die

422

before Margaery Tyrell
walks down that street.

423

To die in the service of the gods

424

would please each and every one of us.

425

We yearn for it.

426

But there is no call for it today.

427

There will be no walk of atonement.

428

Order up.

429

Queen Margaery has already
atoned for her sins

430

by bringing another

431

into the true light of the Seven.

432

Together we announce

433

a new age of harmony.

434

A holy alliance

435

between the Crown and the Faith.

436

Long live King Tommen and
bless you, Queen Margaery!

437

The Crown and the Faith

438

are the twin pillars upon
which the world rests.

439

Together we will restore the
Seven Kingdoms to glory.

440

What's happening?

441

He's beaten us.

442

That's what's happening.

443

When you attack the Faith,
you attack the Crown.

444

Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit

445

to serve as Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

446

I've been a member of the Kingsguard
since before you were born.

447

You don't have to do this. You
don't have to do anything.

448

I have to answer to the gods.

449

Not when you're sitting in that chair.

450

The Crown's decision on
this matter is final.

451

Will I be walking naked in the streets?

452

Or will I spend a few months
in the sept dungeons first

453

to teach me about the gods' mercy?

454

You have served your house and your
king faithfully for many years.

455

And you will continue to do so.

456

But not in this city.

457

You've lost it?

458

Yes, Father.

459

It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.

460

Presumably you still know where it is.

461

You didn't lose Riverrun.

462

You let the Blackfish take it from you.

463

He surprised us. He knows the
castle better than anyone.

464

You did lose the Blackfish
after the Red Wedding.

465

You had him right here in this
hall and you let him leave.

466

Then when I told you to
hunt him down and kill him,

467

you couldn't find him.

468

That's what it means to lose something.

469

Now he's come back and taken Riverrun.

470

I don't think it's fair to blame us...

471

For 300 years we kissed Tully boots,

472

swore oaths to them and their
stinking fish banners.

473

Not again. Riverrun is ours.

474

Take it back!

475

We don't have the men.

476

We've got 10 times as many
men as the damn Blackfish.

477

The Mallisters have risen against us.
And the Blackwoods.

478

The Brotherhood Without Banners is
rallying the commoners against us,

479

raiding our supply trains and camps.

480

Riverrun can withstand
a siege for a year.

481

If I want excuses, I'll
put her in charge.

482

They're laughing at us.

483

All across the Riverlands

484

right down to King's Landing,

485

they're laughing at us.

486

I hear it in my sleep!

487

I'm not dead yet, unfortunately for you.

488

And I'll not leave this world until
they all choke on that laughter.

489

Take that castle back.

490

He'll never yield, Father.

491

Oh, he'll yield.

492

You'll show him the knife you used

493

to kill Robb Stark's child
in his whore mother's belly,

494

and you'll show him the knife you used

495

to open his niece's throat.

496

And you'll remind him who it was

497

that got married at the Red
Wedding in the first place.

498

His nephew.

499

Cheer up, Lord Edmure.

500

You're going home.

501

I'm being sent to deal
with the Blackfish.

502

Apparently Walder Frey
can't manage it on his own

503

because he's 400 years old.

504

Sent me with an army to the Riverlands

505

and a siege that could last months.

506

Better you're elsewhere
at the head of an army

507

than in the sept dungeons.

508

I'm not going to the Riverlands.

509

~T~U~S~U~B~T~I~T~U~L~O~C~O~M~

510

What, then?

511

I'm going to give Bronn the largest
bag of gold anyone's ever seen

512

and have him gather the
best killers he knows.

513

I'll take them to the sept and I'll
remove the High Sparrow's head

514

and every other sparrow head I can find.

515

- You can't.
- He has our son! He stole our son!

516

He's torn our family apart.

517

How should we treat
people who tear us apart?

518

We should treat them
without mercy and we will.

519

But if you kill the High Sparrow,
you won't leave the sept alive.

520

And without you, this
is all for nothing.

521

Stand at the head of our
army where you belong,

522

where Father wanted you.

523

Show our men where their
loyalties belong.

524

Show them what Lannisters are,

525

what we do to our enemies.

526

And take that stupid little castle back

527

because it's ours and because you can.

528

You'll stand trial soon. I
need to be here for you.

529

It will be a trial by combat.

530

I have the Mountain.

531

They've made us both
stronger, all of them.

532

They have no idea how strong we are.

533

No idea what we're going to do to them.

534

We've always been together.

535

We'll always be together.

536

We're the only two people in the world.

537

Why did you help us?

538

The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.

539

The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.

540

Now he lives again.

541

When I last saw you, you were a boy.

542

A fearless boy.

543

Loved to climb the castle
walls, frighten his mother.

544

Who are you?

545

Uncle Benjen.

546

The last letter Jon wrote me

547

said you had been lost beyond the Wall.

548

I led a ranging party
deep into the North

549

to find white walkers.

550

They found us.

551

A white walker stabbed me in
the gut with a sword of ice.

552

Left me there to die.

553

To turn.

554

The Children found me.

555

Stopped the walker's
magic from taking hold.

556

How?

557

The same way they made the
walkers in the first place.

558

You saw it yourself.

559

Dragonglass.

560

A shard of dragonglass
plunged into your heart.

561

You are the Three-Eyed Raven now.

562

I didn't have time to learn.
I can't control anything.

563

You must learn to control it

564

before the Night King comes.

565

Drink.

566

One way or another,

567

he will find his way
to the world of men.

568

When he does,

569

you will be there waiting for him.

570

And you will be ready.

571

Everything all right?

572

How many days' ride to Meereen?

573

A week at best.

574

How many ships will I need to
bring my khalasar to Westeros?

575

Dothraki and all their horses,

576

the Unsullied, the Second Sons...

577

a 1,000 ships easily.

578

- Probably more.
- And who has that many?

579

Nobody.

580

Nobody yet.

581

So we ride for Meereen and after
that we sail for Westeros.

582

And what then?

583

I take what is mine.

584

You weren't made to sit
on a chair in a palace.

585

What was I made for?

586

You're a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn.

587

Wait here.

588

I'm going after her.

589

Wait for me here.

590

Every khal who ever lived
chose three blood riders

591

to fight beside him and guard his way.

592

But I am not a khal.

593

I will not choose three blood riders.

594

I choose you all.

595

I will ask more of you than any khal

596

has ever asked of his khalassar!

597

Will you ride the wooden horses
across the black salt sea?

598

Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits

599

and tear down their stone houses?

600

Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms,

601

the gift Khal Drogo promised me

602

before the Mother of Mountains?

603

Are you with me?

604

Now

605

and always?

11

Easy, easy.

12

Easy.

13

What do you remember?

14

They stabbed me.

15

Olly...

16

he put a knife
in my heart.

17

I shouldn't be here.

18

The lady
brought you back.

19

Afterwards,
after they stabbed you,

20

after you died,
where did you go?

21

What did you see?

22

Nothing.

23

There was nothing
at all.

24

The Lord let you
come back for a reason.

25

Stannis was not the prince
who was promised,

26

but someone has to be.

27

Could you give us
a moment?

28

You were dead.

29

And now you're not.

30

That's completely
fucking mad, seems to me.

31

I can only imagine
how it seems to you.

32

I did what
I thought was right.

33

And I got
murdered for it.

34

And now I'm back.

35

Why?

36

I don't know.

37

Maybe we'll never know.

38

What does it matter?

39

You go on.

40

You fight for as long
as you can.

41

You clean up as much
of the shit as you can.

42

I don't know
how to do that.

43

I thought I did, but...

44

I failed.

45

Good.

46

Now go fail again.

47

<i></i>

48

They think
you're some kind of god.

49

The man who returned
from the dead.

50

I'm not a god.

51

I know that.

52

I saw your pecker.

53

What kind of god would
have a pecker that small?

54



55



56



57

Your eyes
are still brown.

58

Is that still
you in there?

59

I think so.

60

Hold off on burning
my body for now.

61



62

That's funny.

63

You sure that's still
you in there?

64



65



66

- 
- 

67

You all right?

68

Yes.
Yes, I'm fine.

69

Did I ever tell you I used to think
the sea was called the see

70

because it was nothing but
water as far as the eye could see?

71

I don't think so.

72

Sea, see.

73

They're spelled different,
but they sound the same.

74

Yeah, they do.

75

It was before I learned
how to read, obviously.

76

Sam, are you
going to be sick?

77

Won't be long.
We'll be in the south soon.

78

I'm excited
to see Oldtown.

79

Captain says it's the most beautiful
city in Westeros.

80

Are you going
to vomit again?

81

No.
No, no, no.

82

The Citadel
doesn't admit women.

83

There won't be a place for you there
or for Little Sam.

84

I stayed at Castle Black.
There's no women allowed there.

85

The Citadel
isn't Castle Black.

86

I don't have a Jon Snow
or Maester Aemon

87

to help me
bend the rules.

88

I'll stay
in Oldtown, then.

89

By yourself?

90

With a baby
and no money?

91

So if we're not
going to Oldtown,

92

where are you
taking me?

93

To my home.

94

Horn Hill.

95

My father's--
well, my father,

96

but my mother's a kind woman
and my sister's lovely.

97

They'll take care
of you both.

98

"Wherever you go,
I go, too."

99

<i>That's what you said.</i>

100

I said that because I want
you and Little Sam to be safe.

101

That's all I want--

102

to become a maester
so I can help Jon when the time comes

103

so you'll be safe.

104

Us and everyone else
in the world.

105

I don't care about them.

106

Well, no, I do,
but I don't really.

107

I care about
you and him.

108

I know that, Sam.

109

And he does, too.

110

You're the only one
who ever has.

111

If you think
it's for the best,

112

we trust you.

113

I'd feel better if you threw
something at me and stormed off.

114

I'd never do that
to the father of my son.

115



116



117

<i></i>

118

<i></i>

119

That's my father.

120

The man beside him
is Howland Reed,

121

Meera's father.

122

Ser Arthur Dayne.

123

The Sword
of the Morning.

124

Father said he was the best
swordsman he ever saw.

125

Lord Stark.

126

I looked for you
on the Trident.

127

We weren't there.

128

Your friend the usurper

129

would lie beneath the ground
if we had been.

130

The Mad King is dead.

131

Rhaegar lies
beneath the ground.

132

Why weren't you there
to protect your prince?

133

Our prince
wanted us here.

134

Where's my sister?

135

I wish you good fortune
in the wars to come.

136

And now it begins.

137

No.

138

Now it ends.

139



140



141



142



143



144

He's better
than my father.

145

Far better.

146

But Father beat hi

147

Did he?

148

I know he did.

149

Heard the story
a thousand times.

150



151

He stabbed him
in the back.

152

<i></i>

153

What's in the tower?

154

That's enough
for one day.

155

We'll visit again
another time.

156

- I want to see where he's going.
- Time to go.

157

<i></i>

158

Father!

159



160

Why did you do that?

161

Take me back there.
I want to go back.

162

No.

163

- He heard me.
- Maybe.

164

- Maybe he heard the wind.
- He heard me.

165

The past is already written.
The ink is dry.

166

What's in that tower?

167

<i>I want to go back there.</i>

168

I've told you many times,
stay too long

169

where you don't belong
and you will never return.

170

Why do I want to return?

171

So I can be
a cripple again?

172

<i>So I can talk</i>
<i>to an old man in a tree?</i>

173

You think I wanted to sit here
for 1,000 years

174

watching the world
from a distance

175

as the roots
grew through me?

176

So why did you?

177

I was waiting for you.

178

I don't want to be you.

179


I don't blame you.

180

You won't
be here forever.

181

You won't be
an old man in a tree.

182

<i>But before you leave,</i>

183

you must learn.

184

Learn what?

185

Everything.

186



187



188

I don't know how you stand it
in all that leather.

189

If we could
have the room.

190

You look lovely today, my dear.
You really do.

191

How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

192

If you're going
to torture me,

193

just call them back
and get on with it.

194

I am not a torturer.

195

Though it so often is
what people deserve.

196

And it does
provide answers.

197

But they're usually
the wrong answers.

198

My job is to find
the right answers.

199

Do you know
how I do that?

200

I do it by making
people happy.

201

I'd like to make
you happy, Vala.

202

That's your name,
isn't it, Vala?

203


That's all right.

204

I know who you are
and what you've done.

205

You've done a lot.

206

You've sacrificed
your body for a cause,

207

which is more
than most people do.

208

And you've helped
the Sons of the Harpy

209

murder the Unsullied
and the Second Sons.

210

The Unsullied and the Second Sons
are foreign soldiers

211

brought here
by a foreign queen

212

to destroy our city
and our history.

213

I understand.

214

Well, that makes
perfect sense

215

from your perspective.

216

I have a different
perspective, of course.

217

I think it's important that you try
to see things from my perspective

218

just as I will try
to see them from yours.

219

Because that
is the only way

220

that I can make
you and Dom happy.

221

That is how
you pronounce it-- Dom?

222

I'm afraid I don't really
speak the language.

223

Such a handsome boy.

224

Those big, brown eyes.
Good luck keeping the ladies away.

225

Yes, you're a true
liberator, aren't you?

226

You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

227

Children are blameless.

228

I have never hurt them.

229

Your boy is in
no immediate danger,

230

this I swear to you.

231

But between us, dear,

232

you did conspire to kill
the queen's soldiers.

233

We both know the penalty
for that crime.

234

How will poor Dom
get on without his mother?

235

And with his breathing
problem.

236

If I tell you anything,
they'll kill me.

237

So either you kill me
or they do.

238

Yes, from your perspective,
this is a problem.

239

There is a third
option, though.

240

A ship leaving
tomorrow for Pentos.

241

I've already booked passage
for a woman and her young son.

242

I'll even throw in a bag of silver
to help you start again.

243

Though I'm afraid
we'll have to ask

244

one of our leather-clad friends
back in to carry it.

245

Far too heavy for me.

246

The boat sails at dawn.

247

You need to decide now.

248

A new life
for you and Dom

249

or...

250

What should we do
while we wait?

251

To pass the time,
what should we do?

252

<i>What should we</i>
<i>talk about?</i>

253

You speak 19 languages.

254

You must occasionally
use some of them to talk about things.

255

You two, you spend a great deal
of time together.

256

What would you be talking about
if I weren't here?

257

Patrol.

258

When I am going on patrol
with the Unsullied.

259

What we see on patrol.

260

Who we captured on patrol.

261

That's good.
That's very good.

262

But that's a report.

263

I was thinking more
of a conversation.

264

A wise man once said
the true history of the world

265

is the history of great conversations
in elegant rooms.

266

Who said this?

267

Me.

268

Just now.

269

All right,
no conversations.

270

Let's play a game.

271

You don't play games,
either one of you, ever?

272

Games are for children.

273

Missandei:
<i>My master Kraznys</i>

274

would sometimes
make us play games.

275

There, that's a start.

276

- Only the girls.
- No, no, no.

277

Not that.
Of course not that.

278

Innocent games.
Fun games.

279

Drinking games.

280

Missandei:
<i>We do not drink.</i>

281

Until you do.

282

All right.
No drinking.

283

We can play
without drinking.

284

It's a wonderful game.
I invented it.

285

Here's how it works.

286

I make a statement
about your past.

287

If I'm wrong,
I drink.

288

And if I'm right--

289

maybe we can't play
without drinking.

290

<i></i>

291

Oh, you took your time.

292

Sorry.

293

I was busy learning
who funds the Sons of the Harpy.

294

- Some things you can't rush.
- You found out?

295

The Good Masters
of Astapor

296

and the Wise Masters
of Yunkai.

297

With help from their friends
in Volantis.

298

Tyrion:
<i>You see?</i>

299

You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

300

We only have
to worry about

301

the three rich foreign
cities paying for it.

302

We conquered Astapor
and Yunkai once.

303

We will do it again
and execute the Masters.

304

If the Unsullied march off to reconquer
Astapor and Yunkai,

305

who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

306

If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

307

We cannot.

308

The Masters speak
only one language.

309

They spoke it to me
for many years.

310

<i>I know it better</i>
<i>than my mother tongue.</i>

311

If we want them to hear us,
we must speak it back to them.

312

May it be the last thing
they ever hear.

313

You may be right.

314

Grey Worm:
<i>So we will fight them?</i>

315

- Possibly.
- Possibly?

316

It's a conversation.

317

Tell me, can your little
birds get a message

318

to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

319

and benevolent
enslavers of Volantis?

320

Of course.
Men can be fickle,

321

but birds
I always trust.

322



323

Your eye looks
much better, Arthur.

324

How's your mother's jaw?

325

Better.

326

And your father?

327

No one's seen him.

328

And no one will.

329

That worked out
rather nicely.

330

Will Lord Varys
ever come back?

331

I don't think so.

332

Do you miss him?

333

He was nice.

334

He called us
his little birds.

335

He gave us sweets.

336

It's funny you should
mention that.

337

Guess what I happened
to find today.

338

Candied plums
from Dorne.

339



340

Now remember,
if any of your friends

341

like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

342

All I need in return
are whispers.

343

<i></i>

344

Qyburn:
<i>No need to be afraid.</i>

345

This is Ser Gregor.

346

He's friends
with all my friends.

347

Run along now.

348

Varys's little birds?

349

Your little birds now,
Your Grace.

350

What did you do
to him exactly?

351

I haven't been able
to get a clear answer.

352

Oh, a number of things.

353

Does he understand
what we're saying?

354

I mean, to the extent
that he ever understood

355

complete sentences
in the first place.

356

He understands
well enough.

357

So tell him to march
into the Sept

358

and crush the High Sparrow's
head like a melon.

359

The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith
Militant surrounding him.

360

Ser Gregor
can't face them all.

361

And he won't have to.

362

He'll only have
to face one.

363

Has the Faith leveled
official charges yet?

364

Not yet.

365

That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

366

Don't stop at the city.

367

I want little birds
in Dorne,

368

in Highgarden,
in the North.

369

If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

370

I want to hear it.

371

If someone is laughing
at the queen

372

who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

373

I want to hear.

374

I want to know
who they are.

375

I want to know
where they are.

376

Pycelle: <i>As bad as Lord Varys was,</i>
<i>Qyburn is worse.</i>

377

I told them all.
I told them.

378

He's arrogant,
dangerous.

379

You don't get thrown out of the Citadel
without good reason.

380

- And no one listened to my advice.
-<i> </i>

381

<i>So here we are.</i>

382

And what he's done
to Gregor Clegane

383

<i>is an abomination.</i>

384

We never sanctioned
this experiment.

385

I for one think it will
be in our best interest

386

to have the beast dest--

387

<i></i>

388

- Can I help you?
- Why are you here?

389

- My mother--
- I was invited, my dear,

390

to help deal with several
troublesome issues,

391

such as the queen's
imprisonment.

392

Thank you
for bringing it up.

393

It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

394

Margaery is the queen.

395

You are not the queen

396

<i>because you're not</i>
<i>married to the king.</i>

397

I do appreciate
these things

398

can get a bit confusing
in your family.

399

This is a small
council meeting.

400

You have no position
on the small council.

401

I'm the Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard.

402

The Lord Commander
of the Kingsguard

403

does have a position
on the small council.

404

Grand Maester Pycelle,
would you sanction that statement?

405

Well, um...

406

I would say
Ser Gerold Hightower

407

had a seat on
the Mad King's council.

408

<i>Of course,</i>
<i>that was the Mad King.</i>

409

King Robert saw
things differently.

410

- And King--
- 

411

What about
Myrcella's death, Uncle?

412

Do you consider the murder
of your own blood

413

a troublesome issue?

414

The same women
who murdered Myrcella

415

have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

416

We've got a lot
to discuss.

417

All of us together.

418

And seeing as you cannot make us leave,
we best get on with it.

419

No, we cannot
make you leave.

420

And you cannot
make us stay.

421

Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

422

-<i> </i>
-<i> </i>

423


Your Grace.

424

My mother would like to see her
daughter's final resting place.

425

I'm sorry, Your Grace.

426

That's not possible.
Not yet.

427

When will it
be possible?

428

When she's fully atoned
for her sins.

429

You cut off her hair
and marched her naked

430

through the streets
in front of the whole city.

431

That wasn't
the full atonement?

432

No.

433

She must stand trial
before seven septons

434

so we can learn
the true extent of her sins.

435

I want you to let her see
Myrcella's resting place.

436

I am the king.

437

You are.

438

And what does that
mean to you?

439

<i>It means</i>
<i>a great deal to me.</i>

440

The Crown and the Faith

441

are the twin pillars
of the world.

442

<i>Do you know</i>
<i>who told me that?</i>

443

Your mother.

444

My mother
who is unclean?

445

My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

446

How do you think the Mother Above
first came to us?

447

How did men and women

448

first come to feel
the Mother's presence, hmm?

449

It was through
their own mothers.

450

There's a great deal of falsehood
in Cersei. You know that.

451

But when she speaks of you,
the Mother's love outshines it all.

452

Her love for you
is more real

453

than anything else
in this world

454

because it doesn't
come from this world.

455

But you know that.

456

You've felt it.

457

You've seen her
when she talks to you.

458

Yes.

459

<i>It's a great gift.</i>

460

One I never had.

461

Envy.

462

One more thing
for me to atone for.

463

Your Grace,
do you-- may I?

464

Do you mind?

465

It's my knees.

466

Of course.

467

When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

468

she did it
to get back to you.

469

I still don't understand
why you want to put her

470

through any more than
she's already endured.

471

It's not what I want.
It's what the gods want.

472

<i>They make their will known</i>
<i>to us and it's up to us</i>

473

to either accept
or reject it.

474

Please.

475

If we're to be
just and good,

476

then we accept it,
all of us, even kings.

477

A true leader avails himself
of the wisest counsel he can.

478

And no one is wiser
than the gods.

479

My grandfather once said
something similar.

480

Except for the part
about the gods.

481

The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

482

As they work
through your mother.

483

There's so much good
in all of us.

484

The best we can do
is to help each other bring it out.

485



486



487

Who are you?

488

No one.

489



490

Waif: <i>Who were you</i>
<i>before you came here?</i>

491

Arya:
<i>Arya Stark.</i>

492



493

Waif: <i>Tell me about</i>
<i>Arya Stark's family.</i>

494

Her father
was Eddard Stark.

495

Her mother
was Catelyn Stark.

496

She had one sister,
Sansa,

497

and four brothers.

498



499

Three brothers.

500

<i>Robb, Bran,</i>
<i>Rickon.</i>

501

And a half-brother Jon.

502

And where are they now?

503

Arya: <i>They may be dead</i>
<i>for all a girl knows.</i>

504



505



506

Tell me about the Hound.

507

Arya:
<i>Also dead.</i>

508

<i>Arya Stark left him to die.</i>
<i>He was on her list.</i>

509

He was not
on her list anymore.

510

She had taken him
off it.

511

Why? Didn't she want
him dead any longer?

512

Arya:
<i>She did and she did not.</i>

513

She sounds confused.

514

Yes, she was.

515

Who else was on
Arya Stark's funny little list?

516

- 
- Arya: <i>Cersei Lannister.</i>

517

<i>Gregor Clegane.</i>

518

<i>Walder Frey.</i>

519

<i></i>

520

Waif:
<i>That's a short list.</i>

521



522

<i>That can't be everyone</i>
<i>you want to kill.</i>

523

Are you sure you're not
forgetting someone?

524

Which name would you
like a girl to speak?

525



526

Jaqen: <i>If a girl</i>
<i>tells me her name,</i>

527

I will give
her eyes back.

528

A girl has no name.

529

Come.

530

If a girl
is truly no one,

531

<i>she has nothing to fear.</i>

532

Who are you?

533

No one.

534



535

The Umbers are
a famously loyal house.

536

Famously loyal
to the Starks.

537

And you, Lord Karstark.

538

Your people share
blood with the Starks, don't they?

539

But here we are.
Times change.

540

When my father became
Warden of the North,

541

<i>your house refused</i>
<i>to pledge their banners.</i>

542

Your father was a cunt.

543

My beloved father,
the Warden--

544

Your father was a cunt
and that's why you killed him.

545

<i>I might have done</i>
<i>the same to my father</i>

546

if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

547

My father was poisoned
by our enemies.

548

Mmm.

549

Why have you come
to Winterfell, Lord Umber?

550

The bastard Jon Snow
led an army of wildlings past the Wall.

551

We're farther north
than any of you fuckers.

552

<i>Wildlings come down,</i>
<i>we always have to fight them first.</i>

553

I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all my life.

554

But there are too many of them for us
to beat back alone.

555

So now you've come
seeking help?

556

We need to help
each other.

557

The colder it gets, the farther south
those goat fuckers will roam.

558

Won't take them long
to get here.

559

You think a horde
of wildlings can take Winterfell?

560

If they get Jon Snow
leading them, maybe.

561

<i>He knows this place</i>
<i>better than we ever will.</i>

562

Pledge your banners
to House Bolton.

563

Swear loyalty to me
as Warden of the North

564

and we will fight together
to destroy the bastard

565

and all his
wildling friends.

566

I'm not kissing
your fucking hand.

567

Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

568

I'm not doing that either.

569

Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

570

Your father
honored tradition.

571

<i>Knelt for Robb Stark.</i>

572

Called him
King of the North.

573

<i>Was Robb Stark right</i>
<i>to trust your father?</i>

574

Then it appears
we're at a bit of an impasse.

575

Fuck kneeling
and fuck oaths.

576

I've got a gift for you.

577

A girl, I hope.
I prefer redheads.

578

A girl, aye.

579



580

<i>A wild one.</i>

581

I like them wild.

582

And the boy,
nice and young.

583

The way Karstark
likes them.

584

Who's this?

585

Rickon Stark.

586

How do I know
that's Rickon Stark?

587

Welcome home,
Lord Stark.

588

<i></i>

589

It's time.

590

If you have any last words,
now is the time.

591

You shouldn't
be alive.

592

It's not right.

593

Neither was killing me.

594

My mother's still
living at White Harbor.

595

Could you write her?

596

Tell her I died
fighting the wildlings.

597

I had a choice,
Lord Commander.

598

Betray you or betray
the Night's Watch.

599

You brought an army of wildlings
into our lands.

600

An army of murderers
and raiders.

601

If I had to do it all over knowing
where I'd end up,

602

I pray I'd make
the right choice again.

603

I'm sure you would,
Ser Alliser.

604

I fought, I lost.

605

Now I rest.

606

But you, Lord Snow,

607

you'll be fighting
their battles forever.

608



609

We should burn
the bodies.

610

You should.

611

What do you want me
to do with this?

612

Wear it.

613

Burn it.

614

Whatever you want.

615

You have Castle Black.

616

My watch is ended.

Where you gonna go?

South.

4

What are you gonna do?

5

Get warm.

6

I was with you at Hardhome.

7

We saw what's out there.

8

We know it's coming here.

9

How can you leave us now?

10

I did everything I could. You know that.

11

- You swore a vow. - Aye, I pledged
my life to the Night's Watch.

12

- I gave my life.
- For all nights to come.

13

They killed me, Edd! My own brothers.

14

You want me to stay here after that?

15

Riders approaching!

16

Open the gate!

17

This is good soup.

18

Do you remember those kidney
pies Old Nan used to make?

19

With the peas and onions?

20

We never should have left Winterfell.

21

Don't you wish we could go
back to the day we left?

22

I want to scream at myself,
"Don't go, you idiot."

23

How could we know?

24

I spent a lot of time thinking
about what an ass I was to you.

25

I wish I could change everything.

26

We were children.

27

I was awful, just admit it.

28

You were occasionally awful.

29

I'm sure I can't have been great fun.

30

Always sulking in the corner
while the rest of you played.

31

- Can you forgive me?
- There's nothing to forgive.

32

- Forgive me.
- All right.

33

All right, I forgive you.

34

You'd think after thousands of years,

35

the Night's Watch would have
learned how to make a good ale.

36

Where will you go?

37

Where will we go?

38

If I don't watch over you, Father's
ghost will come back and murder me.

39

Where will we go?

40

I can't stay here, not
after what happened.

41

There's only one place we can go.

42

Home.

43

Should we tell the Boltons
to pack up and leave?

44

We'll take it back from them.

45

I don't have an army.

46

How many wildlings did you save?

47

They didn't come here to serve me.

48

They owe you their lives.

49

You think they'll be safe here if Roose
Bolton remains Warden of the North?

50

- Sansa.
- Winterfell is our home.

51

It's ours and Arya's and
Bran's and Rickon's.

52

Wherever they are, it
belongs to our family.

53

We have to fight for it.

54

I'm tired of fighting.

55

It's all I've done since I left home.

56

I've killed brothers
of the Night's Watch.

57

I've killed wildlings. I've
killed men that I admire.

58

I hanged a boy younger than Bran.

59

I fought and I lost.

60

If we don't take back the
North, we'll never be safe.

61

I want you to help me.

62

But I'll do it myself if I have to.

63

My lady.

64

Ser Davos.

65

Will you stay here at Castle Black?

66

I will do as Jon Snow commands.

67

You serve Jon Snow now?

68

He's the prince that was promised.

69

Forgive me, my lady, I
thought that was Stannis.

70

What happened down there?

71

There was a battle.
Stannis was defeated.

72

And Shireen?

73

What happened to the princess?

74

I saw what happened.

75

I saw Stannis' forces
defeated in the field.

76

My lady, I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.

77

We've met before.

78

I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

79

Before Renly was assassinated
with bloodmagic.

80

That's in the past now.

81

Yes, it's in the past.

82

It doesn't mean I forget.

83

Or forgive.

84

He admitted it, you know.

85

Who did?

86

Stannis.

87

Just before I executed him.

88

The Defender of the Vale!

89

Uncle Petyr!

90

My lord.

91

Come and see.

92

I missed your name day. Go on.

93

A falcon!

94

A gyrfalcon.

95

The greatest and rarest of birds.

96

Last time I saw you, Baelish,

97

you told me you were taking Sansa
Stark home with you to the Fingers.

98

Indeed I was.

99

And yet not long ago,
we received reports

100

that she has been married to
Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

101

On our way to the Fingers, we were set
upon by a large force of Bolton men.

102

Seemed to know exactly
when we were traveling

103

and exactly whom we were transporting.

104

Do you take me for a fool?

105

Tell me, Lord Royce,

106

how many people knew of my
travel plans with Sansa Stark?

107

I shared my intentions with you

108

and no one else.

109

Slander a man in his own home,

110

you might find yourself
crossing swords with him.

111

Your home is the Vale. The Lord
of the Vale stands before us.

112

And only his judgment concerns me.

113

Shall we throw him
through the Moon Door?

114

My lord.

115

My lord, I have always been
faithful to House Arryn.

116

To your father, to your
mother, and now to you.

117

Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?

118

Lord Royce has served the Vale well.

119

He's enjoyed a distinguished
military career.

120

If we could trust his absolute loyalty,

121

he would make a capable
commander in the wars to come.

122

You can trust my absolute
loyalty, my lord.

123

I think he deserves one more chance.
What do you say?

124

Fine.

125

I bring good news.

126

My friends in the North tell me
Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

127

I expect she's headed to Castle Black

128

where her brother serves
as Lord Commander.

129

But she won't be safe there, not
with the Boltons after her.

130

She's my cousin.

131

We should help her.

132

That was my instinct as well.

133

Our lord has spoken.

134

Gather the Knights of the Vale.

135

The time has come to join the fray.

136

You invite the enemy into our city?

137

I did.

138

As a clever man once told me,

139

"We make peace with our
enemies, not our friends."

140

I don't make peace with
the queen's enemies.

141

I kill the queen's enemies.

142

Yes, that's the military approach.

143

And how has that worked here in Meereen?

144

I represent the diplomatic approach.

145

Our queen tried to make
peace with the Masters

146

and they tried to murder her.

147

We enter these negotiations
with open eyes.

148

Trust me. My own recent
experience with slavery

149

has taught me the horrors
of that institution.

150

How many days were you a slave?

151

Long enough to know.

152

Not long enough to understand.

153

I bought this dwarf for
a single gold honor.

154

And somehow you've risen

155

to the top of the Great
Pyramid of Meereen.

156

It's most impressive.

157

And now you speak for the
Good Masters of Astapor.

158

Here's to reversals of fortune.

159

We came here to meet the queen

160

and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

161

Let's make this simple, shall we?
Tell me what you want.

162

We want you to leave Slaver's Bay.

163

Take your dragons and
your mercenaries and go.

164

Queen Daenerys won't
stay in Meereen forever.

165

Her path takes her westward.

166

When we last met, I offered her ships

167

so she could return to Westeros where
she belongs. She refused them.

168

She refused them because
hundreds of thousands

169

of men, women, and children
still lived in chains.

170

As they have since the dawn of time.

171

- Not anymore.
- You think you're a free man now?

172

You still follow orders.

173

Just because your master
has silver hair and tits

174

doesn't mean she's not a master.

175

Friends, friends, friends, please.

176

There have always been those with wealth
and power and those with nothing.

177

That is the way of the world. I'm not
here to change the way of the world.

178

Slavery is the way of our world.

179

You don't need slaves to make money.

180

There haven't been slaves in
Westeros for hundreds of years

181

and I grew up richer than any of you.

182

But our queen recognizes that she erred

183

by abolishing slavery

184

without providing a new
system to replace it.

185

So here is the queen's proposal.

186

Slavery will never return to Meereen,

187

but she will give the other
cities of Slaver's Bay

188

time to adjust to the new order.

189

What does that mean?

190

Instead of abolishing slavery overnight,

191

we will give you seven
years to end the practice.

192

Slaveholders will be compensated

193

for their losses, of
course, at fair prices.

194

In exchange, you will cut off

195

your support for the Sons of the Harpy.

196

We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.

197

Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.

198

I do hope you accept, my friends.

199

You will not receive a better offer.

200

Let us sail on the tide of freedom

201

instead of being drowned by it.

202

And as a parting gift to
our honored guests...

203

Give freedom a chance.

204

See if it doesn't taste every bit
as good as what came before.

205

_

206

_

207

_

208

Perhaps I should translate for you.

209

We speak the Common Tongue.

210

- Excellent.
- You met with the slavers today.

211

I did.

212

Our brothers and sisters
died fighting this scum.

213

Now you invite them to our
city and drink wine with them.

214

I imagine this room was built

215

so the rulers could
intimidate the ruled.

216

But I am not your ruler.

217

I'm not the Breaker of Chains.

218

I'm not the Unburnt.

219

And I am certainly not
the Mother of Dragons.

220

You are a stranger here.

221

So why do you represent Meereen
in these talks with our enemies?

222

Because our queen chose
me as her advisor.

223

Until she returns from her travels...

224

When does she return?

225

Soon. You have my word.

226

We don't know you. We don't trust you.
We know Torgo Nudho.

227

We fight with him against the Masters.
We trust him.

228

And that is exactly why Grey Worm
took part in these negotiations.

229

As commander of the Unsullied, he
knows how to defeat the slavers

230

and he knows when it
is time to make peace.

231

You have made peace with the slavers?

232

We offered terms.

233

_

234

_

235

_

236

_

237

_

238

_

239

_

240

_

241

_

242

_

243

_

244

_

245

- Do not use me for your lies.
- Those men respect you.

246

They respect me because
they know who I am.

247

- They know I am loyal.
- As do I.

248

I am loyal to my queen, not you.

249

If you betray her work,
you are my enemy.

250

I am not betraying her work. I
am trying to save her city.

251

You promised the slavers
they could keep slavery.

252

For a short time.

253

Seven years is not a
short time for a slave.

254

You're right.

255

Slavery is a horror that
should be ended at once.

256

War is a horror that
should be ended at once.

257

I can't do both today.

258

You are wrong to trust these men.

259

I don't trust the Masters. I
trust their self-interest.

260

They're trustworthy if they're convinced

261

that working with me is
in their self-interest.

262

You don't know them. You
don't understand them.

263

We are not human in their eyes.

264

They look at me and see a weapon.

265

They look at her and see a whore.

266

They look at me and they see
a misshapen little beast.

267

Their contempt is their weakness.

268

They'll underestimate us every time and
we will use that to our advantage.

269

You will not use them.

270

They will use you. That is what they do.

271

You all right?

272

Why don't you sit and catch your breath?

273

I'm fine.

274

I don't think you could ride the dragon.

275

20 years ago, maybe.

276

- What?
- Our queen.

277

She's wild, you know. Don't
let her size fool you.

278

It's hard enough for me
and I'm a young man.

279

You, I don't think your
heart could take it.

280

Must make you angry that
our queen chose me.

281

Makes me sad. You'll
disappoint her before long.

282

- She'll move on.
- We'll all disappoint her before long.

283

We need each other right now. After
we're done needing each other...

284

Oh, I don't want to fight
you, Jorah the Andal.

285

What do I have to gain?

286

If I win, I'm the shit
who killed an old man.

287

If I lose, I'm the shit who
was killed by an old man.

288

You didn't get much discipline
as a child, did you?

289

None.

290

The road running through the Horse Gate,

291

they call that the godsway.

292

Eastern Market, Western Market.

293

When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed
to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen,

294

the widows of the dead khals.

295

That's where they would have taken her,

296

the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

297

What are you doing?

298

It's forbidden to carry
weapons in the sacred city.

299

Isn't it forbidden to sneak into
their city and steal their khaleesi?

300

If they spot us and we're unarmed,

301

we'll say we're traders heading
for the Western Market.

302

But if they see weapons...

303

You're asking a dog to
hand over his teeth.

304

There's 100,000 of them down there.

305

We can't fight our way out.

306

We wait till dark, and
then we'll find her.

307

I'm very attached to this knife.

308

Don't worry. It didn't touch you.

309

You know what happens?

310

I know what happens.

311

I'll do it myself.

312

I should have been born a Dothraki.

313

Come on.

314

_

315

316

_

320

_

321

_

322

_

323

Told you, I'm very
attached to this knife.

324

You all right?

325

If they find a body with a stab wound,

326

the whole city will be looking for us.

327

328

357

358

- No, don't hurt her.
- She'll give us away.

359

We have to go now.

360

We will never get out
of Vaes Dothrak alive.

361

All we can do is try.

362

No.

363

We can do more than that.

364

And you're going to help me.

365

_

366

_

367

_

368

If I were to let you leave
right now, where would you go?

369

What would you seek out?

370

I'd go to my brother,

371

my husband, my family.

372

Of course, but for you, that
means seeking out money,

373

finery, power.

374

Seeking out your family
means seeking out sin.

375

I'm not maligning you.

376

I sought those things out, too.

377

To the exclusion of all else.

378

My father was a cobbler.

379

He died when I was young
and I took over his shop.

380

He was a simple man and
he made simple shoes.

381

But I found that the more
work I put into my shoes,

382

the more people wanted them.

383

Fine leather, ornamentation,

384

detailing, and time.

385

Time most of all.

386

Dozens of hours spent on a single pair.

387

Quality takes time.

388

Yes.

389

I imagine you've worn a year

390

of someone's life on your back.

391

The highborn liked to cover
their feet with my time

392

and they paid well for the privilege.

393

I used their money

394

to buy a taste of their
lives for myself.

395

Each time I indulged,

396

I felt myself ascending
to something better.

397

And one day you walked
through a graveyard

398

and realized it was all for nothing

399

and set out on the
path to righteousness.

400

Book of the Stranger, verse 25.

401

You know "The Seven-Pointed Star."

402

Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.

403

Yes, yes, she does enjoy
reading at people.

404

You're close.

405

But it wasn't a graveyard.

406

It was a feast.

407

I bought old fine wine

408

and young pretty girls

409

and invited my friends to
come and share it all.

410

We passed around the wine,
passed around the women,

411

and soon we fell into a stupor.

412

I woke before dawn.

413

I could barely stand.

414

Everyone else was asleep on
the couches or on the floor,

415

lying in heaps next to
their fine clothes.

416

The truth of their bodies laid bare.

417

I could smell them

418

beneath the incense and the perfume

419

and the fine food that had
already started to turn.

420

And I saw it with perfect clarity.

421

I saw what my sins were.

422

The gold I had, the wine I
drank, the women I used,

423

my ceaseless struggle to
maintain my position.

424

It was all part of a story.

425

A story I was telling
myself about who I was.

426

A collection of lies

427

that would disappear in the light.

428

The people I was trying
to climb away from,

429

the beggars in the street,

430

the poor,

431

they were closer to the
truth than I ever was.

432

So what did you do?

433

I left to go and find them.

434

I didn't even put on my shoes.

435

I walked out the door
and never went back.

436

Come, let's go and see him.

437

- Who?
- Your brother.

438

Loras.

439

Loras.

440

Listen to me.

441

You need to stay strong.

442

I can't stay strong.

443

I never was strong.

444

You are strong.

445

You are the future of our house,

446

the future of our family.

447

I don't care about that.

448

Have you... have you told them that?

449

That you don't care?

450

I just want it to stop.

451

Help me.

452

They want me to help you.

453

They want me to help tear you down.

454

That's why he's letting me see you.
I know it is.

455

And if either of us give in to
what they want, then they win.

456

Let them win.

457

Just make it stop.

458

Please.

459

All right.

460

And now, how to avert disaster
with our current predicament.

461

This High Sparrow.

462

I have dealt with fanatics of
every description, Your Grace.

463

Not setting them off, that's
the most important thing.

464

You are beset with enemies
both within and without.

465

What are you doing here?

466

I am advising the king on
our current predicament.

467

- Leave.
- I am a member of the small council.

468

The king...

469

Is this a small council meeting?

470

Obviously not.

471

I'm here to lend my
wisdom and my support.

472

Thank you for your
counsel, Grand Maester.

473

That will be all for now.

474

Your Grace.

475

Since I've missed the past
several small council meetings,

476

I wanted to speak to you
about a few things.

477

I've been thinking about
the High Sparrow.

478

As have we all, unfortunately.

479

We need to be careful in
dealing with such a man.

480

To prevent things from
escalating any further.

481

We have to be careful
not to antagonize him.

482

He has Margaery. We
can't put her at risk.

483

- He's dangerous.
- Look at me.

484

What did they do to me?

485

To the king's own mother?

486

It's all right.

487

It's done. It's in the past.

488

And of course

489

Margaery's safety is paramount.

490

You don't like Margaery, do you?

491

Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

492

Margaery is the queen.

493

Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

494

Not just for their own
sake, but for everyone's.

495

The High Sparrow has no
respect for kings or queens.

496

No respect for anything in this world.

497

He has no use for the
things of this world.

498

He wants to knock them down
and replace them with what?

499

With fantasies.

500

With beggars in the street.

501

With nothing.

502

Mother...

503

there's something I want to tell you.

504

Something the High Sparrow told me.

505

You've spoken with him?

506

I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out I told...

507

It would be a breach of confidence
which he would not take lightly

508

given his constant
prattling about the truth.

509

I am your mother.

510

You can always trust me.

511

The small council meeting has been
postponed on the king's orders.

512

I would have thought we were
perfectly clear the first time.

513

- You're not welcome. - You once
spoke of your respect for our father

514

because he understood the necessity
of working with one's rivals.

515

My dear, you have been stripped
of your dignity and authority,

516

publically shamed, and
confined to the Red Keep.

517

What's left to work with?

518

Cersei is the mother of the king.

519

She has the king's ear and his trust.

520

And the king has been speaking regularly

521

with the High Sparrow about
Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

522

The High Sparrow seized power

523

knowing full well we'd bicker amongst
ourselves instead of seizing it back.

524

Here we are. Well done to us.

525

Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms

526

rests in his dirty peasant hands.

527

In a few days, he'll
have a trial for me.

528

But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

529

Yes, Margaery will repent her sins

530

before the good people of the city.

531

Oh, no.

532

That cannot happen.

533

That will not happen.

534

I agree.

535

You've got the second
largest army in Westeros.

536

You'll bring them into the city,

537

stop Queen Margaery's
humiliation before it starts,

538

and take her back into Crown custody.

539

The king has ordered me to take no
action against the High Sparrow

540

or the Faith Militant out of
fear for the queen's safety.

541

You will take no action at all.

542

When the Tyrell armies
come, you will stand down.

543

Are you expressly forbidden
from standing down?

544

No, but if the king should call...

545

The whole thing will be over before
anyone can call on you to do anything.

546

When the High Sparrow is in
custody or dead, preferably,

547

and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,

548

do you think the king will
be angry at the outcome?

549

You hate these fanatics
as much as we do.

550

You hate what they've done to your son.

551

Do you want Lancel back?

552

Or have you given him up for good?

553

Of course I want him back.

554

Then stand aside

555

and let the people that took
him from you be destroyed.

556

If it doesn't go as planned,

557

the sparrows have many
friends in this city.

558

We'll have civil war. Many will die.

559

Many will die no matter what we do.

560

Better them than us.

561

They told me you were home
and I didn't believe it.

562

"Theon Greyjoy?" I said.

563

"He's dead.

564

He's been dead a long time."

565

He let you go?

566

I escaped.

567

I can't hear you.

568

I escaped.

569

Look at me.

570

Look at me!

571

Men died trying to rescue you.

572

Good men.

573

My men.

574

I'm sorry.

575

You were my brother.

576

You were a spoiled little
cunt, but you were my brother

577

and I risked everything for you

578

and you betrayed me.

579

I know. I know and I'm sorry.

580

Stop saying that.

581

He broke me.

582

He broke me into 1,000 pieces.

583

- I know.
- You don't know.

584

He sent us one of those pieces.

585

That's why I came for you.

586

Why did you come here?

587

Where else could I go?

588

You heard Father was dead and you
thought you'd claim the crown?

589

No, no. I only heard he
died after we docked.

590

You happen to show up on Pyke
right before the kingsmoot?

591

I didn't know.

592

You think any ironborn
wants you to be king

593

after what you've done?

594

I don't want to be king.

595

What do you want?

596

I should have listened to you.
You're the only one...

597

That doesn't matter anymore.
Stop crying.

598

Look at me.

599

Tell me what you want.

600

You should rule the Iron Islands.

601

Let me help you.

602

They've cleaned you up nicely.

603

You know who I am?

604

A lord.

605

Yes.

606

A lord.

607

You've seen my banners?

608

The flayed man.

609

Does that worry you at all?

610

You eat them after?

611

No.

612

Then I've seen worse.

613

You served the Starks?

614

Aye. They put me in chains

615

and put a sword at my throat,

616

so I served them.

617

The Starks have been
gone for a long time,

618

but you kept protecting Rickon.

619

He'd fetch a good price
to the right buyer.

620

I served his family a long time.

621

Didn't get no wages.

622

Way I see it, I'm owed.

623

Be that as it may,

624

Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.

625

He's mine.

626

So what use could I
possibly have for you?

627

I can give you what you want.

628

And you're sure you know what that is?

629

Same thing men always want.

630

And when they really want it,
they give it a bath first.

631

You're a good talker.

632

I like that.

633

You're a much better
talker than Theon Greyjoy.

634

That so?

635

I had to work hard to get him talking.

636

But he talked.

637

They all do.

638

He told me everything.

639

All about the Stark boys,

640

who helped them escape,

641

and how she did it.

642

Open the gate!

643

Sorry about the food.

644

It's not what we're known for.

645

That's all right. There are
more important things.

646

A letter for you, Lord Commander.

647

I'm not Lord Commander anymore.

648

"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow.

649

You allowed thousands of
wildlings past the Wall.

650

You have betrayed your own kind.

651

You have betrayed the North.

652

Winterfell is mine, bastard.
Come and see.

653

Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon.

654

His direwolf's skin is on my floor.

655

Come and see. I want my bride back.

656

Send her to me, bastard, and I will not
trouble you or your wildling lovers.

657

Keep her from me and I will
ride north and slaughter

658

every wildling man, woman, and
babe living under your protection.

659

You will watch as I skin them living.
You... "

660

Go on.

661

It's just more of the same.

662

"You will watch as my soldiers
take turns raping your sister.

663

You will watch as my dogs

664

devour your wild little brother.

665

Then I will spoon your eyes from their
sockets and let my dogs do the rest.

666

Come and see. Ramsay
Bolton, Lord of Winterfell

667

and Warden of the North."

668

Lord of Winterfell and
Warden of the North.

669

His father's dead.

670

Ramsay killed him.

671

- And now he has Rickon.
- We don't know that.

672

Yes, we do.

673

How many men does he have in his army?

674

I heard him say 5,000 once when he
was talking about Stannis's attack.

675

How many do you have?

676

That can march and fight?

677

2,000.

678

The rest are children and old people.

679

You're the son of the last
true Warden of the North.

680

Northern families are loyal.
They'll fight for you if you ask.

681

A monster has taken our
home and our brother.

682

We have to go back to
Winterfell and save them both.

That's it. Get it right to the top.

2

Steady. Steady.

3

Up she goes.

4

Hey, come on. Put your
back into it, huh?

5

Here you are, son.

6

- Oh, gentlemen, please.
- To my right.

7

And you lot, come on.
Come on, get it moving.

8

Come on, come on.

9

In all my days I've never seen
a man swing an ax like that.

10

How many men did it
take to cut you down?

11

Just one.

12

He must have been some kind of monster.

13

He was a woman.

14

I think some of the men
are a bit afraid of you.

15

I'm used to it.

16

When I found you, I thought
you'd been dead for days.

17

The way you were stinking already

18

and you had bugs all over you

19

and bone was coming through right there.

20

I was gonna give you a proper
burial and then you coughed.

21

Oh, nearly shit myself.

22

I reckoned you were gonna die

23

by the time I loaded you on
the wagon, but you didn't.

24

Now, I reckoned you'd die a dozen
more times over the next few days,

25

but you didn't. What kept you going?

26

Hate.

27

No, there's a reason you're still here.

28

Aye, there's a reason. I'm a big
fucker and I'm tough to kill.

29

No, a reason.

30

Gods aren't done with you yet.

31

I've heard that before.

32

Man was talking about a
different god, though.

33

Well, maybe he was right.

34

I don't know much about the gods.

35

You're in the wrong line of work.

36

Oh, there's plenty of
pious sons of bitches

37

who think they know the
word of god or gods.

38

I don't. I don't even
know their real names.

39

Maybe it is the Seven. Or
maybe it's the old gods.

40

Or maybe it's the Lord of Light.

41

Or maybe they're all the
same fucking thing.

42

I don't know.

43

What matters, I believe,

44

is that there's something
greater than us.

45

And whatever it is, it's got
plans for Sandor Clegane.

46

You didn't know me back in my time.

47

You don't know the things I've done.

48

I've heard stories.

49

If the gods are real...

50

why haven't they punished me?

51

They have.

52

Your Grace.

53

What are we reading today?

54

The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness.

55

Chapter three, verse 12.

56

Ah, "As water rounds the
stones, smoothing..."

57

"Smoothing what was jagged,
so does a woman's love

58

calm a man's brute nature.

59

A wife salves her husband's wounds,

60

a mother sings her son to sleep."

61

You learn quickly.

62

There are some who know every
verse of the sacred text,

63

but don't have a drop of the
Mother's mercy in their blood

64

and savages who can't read at all

65

who understand the Father's wisdom.

66

For years I pretended

67

to love the poor, the afflicted.

68

I had pity for them, but
I never loved them.

69

They disgusted me.

70

They are hard to love.

71

The poor disgust us because they are us,

72

shorn of our illusions.

73

They show us what we'd look
like without our fine clothes.

74

How'd we smell without perfume.

75

Can I ask you about a personal matter?

76

Of course.

77

The king mentioned that
since your reunion,

78

you haven't joined him
in the marriage bed.

79

No.

80

You have a duty, Your Grace.

81

To your husband, your
king, your country,

82

to the gods themselves.

83

It's just...

84

the desires that once
drove me no longer do.

85

Congress does not require desire

86

on the woman's part, only patience.

87

The king must have an heir

88

if we are to continue our good work.

89

Forgive me.

90

Sometimes the true path is hard to find.

91

Hard to find

92

and harder still to walk upon.

93

But you've made great progress.

94

I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead.

95

My grandmother?

96

Yes.

97

The Queen of Thorns is
a remarkable woman,

98

a strong woman,

99

and an unrepentant sinner.

100

You must teach her the new way

101

as she taught you the old.

102

Or I fear for her safety,

103

body and soul.

104

Does it move or talk?

105

I want to speak with you alone.

106

Septa Unella has been my
true friend and counselor.

107

Oh, this is madness!

108

You're not in your
sanctuary now, my dear.

109

All I have to do is whistle and my men
will stroll in here and bash you about...

110

- Grandmother.
- Until I tell them to stop.

111

If I tell them to stop.

112

- You could use a good bashing.
- Grandmother, please.

113

What have they done to you?

114

You marched against the High Sparrow,

115

- against the Faith.
- We marched for you.

116

The gods could have punished you
and Father, but they didn't.

117

- They showed mercy.
- And what about your brother?

118

What mercy did they show him?

119

Loras's only hope is to confess
his crimes and repent.

120

If he does, the Faith will allow
him to return to Highgarden.

121

He'll have to renounce
his name and title...

122

- Have you lost your mind?
- And live his life as a penitent.

123

He is the heir to Highgarden,
the future of House Tyrell.

124

He can begin again.

125

As a mindless fanatic.

126

As a free man.

127

You will leave for Highgarden today.

128

There is no law that
says you must stay here.

129

I am the queen.

130

It is my duty to serve
my husband the king.

131

But you should leave, Grandmother.

132

Your place is at home.

133

I will never leave you. Never.

134

You must.

135

Go home.

136

Find comfort in prayer and good works.

137

The Mother watches over us all.

138

I'll see you soon, my dear.

139

Seven blessings to you, Grandmother.

140

Shall we pray?

141

We said we'd fight with you, King Crow,

142

when the time comes and we meant it,

143

but this isn't what we agreed to.

144

These aren't white walkers.

145

This isn't an army of the dead.

146

This isn't our fight.

147

If it weren't for him,
none of us would be here.

148

All of you would be meat
in the Night King's army.

149

And I'd be a pile of charred
bones just like Mance.

150

Remember Mance's camp?

151

It stretched all the way to the horizon.

152

And look at us now.

153

Look what's left of us.

154

And if we lose this, we're gone.

155

Dozens of tribes,
hundreds of generations.

156

Be like we were never there at all.

157

We'll be the last of the free folk.

158

That's what'll happen to you if we lose.

159

The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers,

160

they know you're here.

161

They know that more than half
of you are women and children.

162

After they finish with me,
they'll come for you.

163

You're right.

164

This isn't your fight.

165

You shouldn't have to come
to Winterfell with me.

166

I shouldn't be asking you.

167

It's not the deal we made.

168

I need you with me if
we're going to beat them,

169

and we need to beat them if
you're going to survive.

170

The crows killed him because
he spoke for the free folk

171

when no other southerners would.

172

He died for us.

173

If we are not willing to do the
same for him, we're cowards.

174

And if that's what we are,

175

we deserve to be the
last of the free folk.

176

Snow.

177

Are you sure they'll come?

178

We're not clever like you southerners.

179

When we say we'll do
something, we do it.

180

I heard you were leaving King's Landing.

181

That is hardly your concern.

182

Your grandson is still a prisoner.

183

You'll leave him rotting in a cell?

184

Loras rots in a cell because of you.

185

The High Sparrow rules
this city because of you.

186

Our two ancient houses face
collapse because of you

187

and your stupidity.

188

You're right.

189

I made a terrible mistake.

190

I carry it with me every single day.

191

Good.

192

I delivered an army of
fanatics onto our doorstep.

193

And now we must fight them together.

194

We need each other.

195

I wonder if you're the worst
person I've ever met.

196

At a certain age, it's hard to recall.

197

But the truly vile do stand
out through the years.

198

Do you remember the
way you smirked at me

199

when my grandson and granddaughter
were dragged off to their cells?

200

I do. I'll never forget it.

201

You love your granddaughter.

202

I love my son.

203

It's the only truth I know.

204

We must defend them.

205

I'm leaving this wretched
city as fast as I can

206

before that shoeless zealot
throws me into one of his cells.

207

If you're half as bright
as you think you are,

208

you'll find a way out of here, too.

209

Never.

210

I'll never leave my son.

211

What'll you do, then?

212

You have no support. Not anymore.

213

Your brother's gone. The
High Sparrow saw to that.

214

The rest of your family
have abandoned you.

215

The people despise you.

216

You're surrounded by
enemies, thousands of them.

217

You're going to kill
them all by yourself?

218

You've lost, Cersei.

219

It's the only joy I can
find in all this misery.

220

Pick the pace up.

221

Keep going.

222

Keep it moving!

223

Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege.

224

Someone needs to teach those
sad twats how to dig trenches.

225

Someone certainly does.

226

Oh, no. Not me.

227

I'm just an upjumped sellsword.

228

You're an anointed knight.
There's quite a difference.

229

Aye, knights don't get paid.

230

You have better instincts than any
officer in the Lannister army.

231

That's like saying I have a bigger cock
than anyone in the Unsullied army.

232

I expect to command all the
Lannister forces before long.

233

You can be the right hand I lost.

234

You promised me a lordship and a castle

235

and a highborn beauty for a wife.

236

And you'll get all three.
A Lannister always...

237

Don't say it. Don't fucking say it.

238

Come out and fight us, Blackfish.

239

We have Lord Edmure.

240

Yield the castle or we'll hang him.

241

This is your last warning.

242

Yield the castle.

243

You think I won't do it, old man?

244

I sliced your niece's
throat from ear to ear.

245

And where were you? Running and
hiding like a fucking coward.

246

Yield the castle or I cut his throat.

247

Go on, then. Cut his throat.

248

Lothar, is it?

249

Ser Jaime.

250

We didn't know you were coming.

251

'Cause you didn't set
a proper perimeter.

252

You just allowed 8,000 men
to approach unchallenged.

253

Good thing we're friends or we'd be
fucking you in the ass right now.

254

Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.

255

Walder.

256

Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.

257

Only a fool makes threats he's
not prepared to carry out.

258

Now let's say I threatened to hit you

259

unless you shut your mouth,
but you kept talking.

260

- What do you think I'd do?
- I don't give a rat's...

261

I'm here by the king's command
to take back this castle.

262

Have him bathed and fed.

263

Unless you'd like to take his place.

264

Apologies, Ser Jaime.

265

Do as he says.

266

The siege is now under my command.

267

The next time the Blackfish
looks out from those ramparts,

268

he'll see an army at his
gates, not whatever this is.

269

Have your lads start digging
perimeter trenches.

270

Set pickets every hundred yards.

271

And work double-time on those
siege towers and trebuchets.

272

Those are our siege towers...

273

As I said, the siege
is under my command.

274

If that's not to your liking, go home.

275

Get word to the Blackfish.

276

I want a parley.

277

A parley or a fight?

278

He's an old man.

279

You've got one hand.

280

My money's on the old boy.

281

Lady Mormont.

282

Welcome to Bear Island.

283

I remember when you were born, my lady.

284

You were named for my Aunt Lyanna.

285

It was said she was a great beauty.
I'm sure you will be, too.

286

I doubt it. My mother
wasn't a great beauty

287

or any other kind of beauty.

288

She was a great warrior, though.

289

She died fighting for your brother Robb.

290

I served under your uncle at
Castle Black, Lady Lyanna.

291

He was also a great warrior
and an honorable man.

292

I was his steward. In fact...

293

I think we've had enough small talk.
Why are you here?

294

Stannis Baratheon
garrisoned at Castle Black

295

before he marched on
Winterfell and was killed.

296

He showed me the letter you wrote
to him when he petitioned for men.

297

- It said...
- I remember what it said.

298

Bear Island knows no king

299

but the King in the North
whose name is Stark.

300

Robb is gone,

301

but House Stark is not.

302

And it needs your support
now more than ever.

303

I've come with my sister to ask
for House Mormont's allegiance.

304

As far as I understand, you're a Snow

305

and Lady Sansa is a Bolton.

306

Or is she a Lannister?

307

I've heard conflicting reports.

308

I did what I had to do
to survive, my lady.

309

But I am a Stark. I
will always be a Stark.

310

If you say so. In any case,

311

you don't just want my allegiance.
You want my fighting men.

312

Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed
to keep Winterfell, my lady.

313

It is our duty to stop him.

314

Even more so because he holds our
brother Rickon Stark as prisoner.

315

What you have to understand,
my lady, is that...

316

I understand that I'm responsible for
Bear Island and all who live here.

317

So why should I sacrifice one more
Mormont life for someone else's war?

318

If it please, my lady,

319

I understand how you feel.

320

I don't know you, Ser...?

321

Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.

322

You needn't ask your
maester about my house.

323

It's rather new.

324

All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth.

325

How is it you understand how I feel?

326

You never thought you'd find
yourself in your position.

327

Being responsible for so many
lives at such a young age.

328

I never thought I'd be in my position.

329

I was a crabber's son,
then I was a smuggler.

330

And now I find myself
addressing the lady

331

of a great house in time of war.

332

But I'm here because this
isn't someone else's war.

333

It's our war.

334

Go on, Ser Davos.

335

Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont,

336

made that man his steward.

337

He chose Jon to be his
successor because he knew

338

he had the courage to do what was right,

339

even if it meant giving his life.

340

Because Jeor Mormont and
Jon Snow both understood

341

that the real war isn't between
a few squabbling houses.

342

It's between the living and the dead.

343

And make no mistake, my lady,

344

the dead are coming.

345

Is this true?

346

Your uncle fought them at
the Fist of the First Men.

347

I fought them at Hardhome.

348

We both lost.

349

As long as the Boltons hold
Winterfell, the North is divided.

350

And a divided North won't stand a
chance against the Night King.

351

You want to protect your
people, my lady. I understand.

352

But there's no hiding from this.

353

We have to fight and we
need to do it together.

354

House Mormont has kept faith with
House Stark for 1,000 years.

355

We will not break faith today.

356

Thank you, my lady.

357

How many fighting men can we expect?

358

62.

359

- 62?
- We are not a large house,

360

but we're a proud one.

361

And every man from Bear Island

362

fights with the strength
of 10 mainlanders.

363

If they're half as
ferocious as their lady,

364

the Boltons are doomed.

365

Kingslayer.

366

Blackfish.

367

I assume you're here

368

to fulfill the vow you gave my niece.

369

I don't see Sansa and Arya.

370

- I don't have them.
- Pity.

371

Do you wish to resume your captivity?

372

Then why are you here?

373

You know why I'm here.

374

This castle belongs to House Frey.

375

You're trespassing.

376

In the name of King Tommen, I
order you to surrender or...

377

Or you'll kill Edmure?

378

My nephew's marked for
death no matter what.

379

Hang him and be done with it.

380

It won't stop with Edmure.

381

You'll force me to storm the castle.

382

Hundreds will die.

383

Hundreds of mine. Thousands of yours.

384

If you can breach the walls.

385

We'll breach them and kill
every last one of you.

386

But if you surrender,

387

I'll spare the lives of your men.

388

On my honor.

389

Your honor?

390

Bargaining with oathbreakers
is like building on quicksand.

391

The war is over, ser.

392

Why sacrifice living
men to a lost cause?

393

As long as I'm standing,
the war is not over.

394

This is my home.

395

I was born in this castle
and I'm ready to die in it.

396

So you can either attack

397

or try to starve us out.

398

We have enough provisions for two years.

399

Do you have two years, Kingslayer?

400

You clearly have no intention
of saving your men's lives.

401

Why did you come treat with me?

402

Sieges are dull.

403

And I wanted to see you in
person, get the measure of you.

404

Well, now you have.

405

Aye, now I have.

406

I'm disappointed.

407

The answer is no.

408

- Lord Glover, if you could just
hear us out. - I've heard enough.

409

We've only just taken back
this castle from the ironborn.

410

The Boltons helped us do it.

411

Now you want me to fight against them?

412

I could be skinned for
even talking to you.

413

The Boltons are traitors.
Roose Bolton...

414

Have other northern houses
pledged to fight for you?

415

House Mormont.

416

And?

417

We sent ravens to Houses Manderly...

418

I don't care about ravens.

419

You're asking me to join your army.

420

Who is fighting in this army?

421

The bulk of the force is
made up of wildlings.

422

Then the rumors are true.

423

I didn't dare believe them.

424

I received you out of
respect for your father.

425

Now I would like you to leave.

426

House Glover will not
abandon its ancestral home

427

to fight alongside wildlings.

428

- Lord Glover.
- There's nothing else to say.

429

I would remind you that House Glover

430

is pledged to House Stark.

431

Sworn to answer when called upon.

432

Yes, my family served House
Stark for centuries.

433

We wept when we heard
of your father's death.

434

When my brother was lord of this
castle, he answered Robb's call

435

and hailed him King in the North.

436

And where was King Robb

437

when the ironborn attacked this castle?

438

When they threw my wife
and children in prison

439

and brutalized and killed our subjects?

440

Taking up with a foreign whore.

441

Getting himself and those
who followed him killed.

442

I served House Stark once,

443

but House Stark is dead.

444

Why did we have to come here?

445

Some of us still like it.

446

Have a drink at least.

447

I don't want one.

448

Don't go far, love.

449

I'll find you in a bit.

450

Nothing on the Iron Islands
has an ass like that.

451

Doesn't interest you anymore?

452

I'm sorry. I won't joke about it.

453

I'll never hurt you, little brother.

454

Don't you know that?

455

You think Uncle Euron's hunting for us?

456

Of course he is. As long as
we're alive, we're a threat.

457

He'll find us.

458

It's a great big world
and we have fast ships.

459

Drink.

460

I don't want any.

461

I don't care what you want. Drink.

462

Drink it all.

463

You're ironborn, Theon. I know
you've had some bad years.

464

Some bad years?

465

But I'm tired of watching
you cower like a beat dog.

466

Drink the goddamn ale.

467

Now listen to me.

468

I need you.

469

The real Theon Greyjoy, not
this rat shit pretender.

470

Can you find him for me?

471

Drink.

472

You escaped. You hear me?

473

You got away and you're
never going back.

474

We'll get justice for you.

475

If I got justice, my burnt body would
hang over the gates of Winterfell.

476

Fuck justice, then. We'll
get revenge. Drink.

477

Listen to me.

478

If you're so broken that
there's no coming back,

479

take a knife and cut your wrists.

480

End it.

481

But if you're staying,
Theon, I need you.

482

We're gonna sail to Meereen.

483

We're gonna make a pact
with this Dragon Queen.

484

And we're gonna take
back the Iron Islands.

485

Are you with me?

486

Are you really with me?

487

Now, since it's my last night
ashore for a long while,

488

I'm gonna go fuck the tits off this one.

489

Stannis camped here on
his way to Winterfell.

490

And that's a good thing?

491

He was the most experienced
commander in Westeros.

492

He chose this place for a reason.

493

Those mountains are a
natural fortification.

494

There's a stream down
there for the horses.

495

We're not staying here long.

496

Another storm could hit any day.

497

Aye, the snows defeated Stannis

498

as much as the Boltons did.

499

We have to march on Winterfell
now while we still can.

500

2,000 wildlings,

501

200 Hornwoods, 143 Mazins...

502

62 Mormonts.

503

It's not what we'd hoped for.

504

But we still have a chance
if we're careful and smart.

505

For fuck's sake.

506

So he's your most trusted advisor now?

507

Because he secured 62
men from a 10-year-old?

508

Ser Davos is the reason I'm
standing here talking to you

509

and he served Stannis for years.

510

Stannis who lost the Blackwater,

511

who murdered his own brother,
who doesn't have a head?

512

It's not enough. We need more men.

513

There's no time.

514

If we went down to Castle
Cerwyn, I know that Lord...

515

We fight with the army we have.

516

Friends, this is not worth fighting over!

517

This'll be it, now.

518

Right, now we don't
need to be fighting...

519

- Who the fuck are you?
- Hold on.

520

Yeah, who the fuck are you?

521

I was a soldier once.

522

All my superiors thought I was brave.

523

I wasn't. I mean, I
never ran from a fight.

524

Only because I was afraid my
friends would see I was afraid.

525

That's all I was, a coward.

526

We followed orders no matter the orders.

527

Burn that village.

528

Fine, I'm your arsonist.

529

Steal that farmer's crops.
Good, I'm your thief.

530

Kill those young lads so they
won't take up arms against us.

531

I'm your murderer.

532

I remember once a woman screaming at us,

533

calling us animals as we dragged
her son from their hut.

534

But we weren't animals.

535

Animals are true to their nature

536

and we had betrayed ours.

537

I cut that young boy's throat myself

538

as his mother screamed

539

and my friends held her back.

540

That night...

541

I felt such shame.

542

Shame was so heavy on me,

543

I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep.

544

All I could do was stare
into that dark sky

545

and listen to that mother
screaming her son's name.

546

I'll hear her screaming
the rest of my life.

547

Now, I know I can never
bring that lad back.

548

All I can do with time I've got left

549

is bring a little
goodness into the world.

550

That's all any of us can do, isn't it?

551

Never too late to stop robbing people,

552

to stop killing people.

553

Start helping people.

554

It's never too late to come back.

555

And it's not about waiting for
the gods to answer your prayers.

556

It's not even about the gods.
It's about you.

557

Learning you have to answer
your prayers yourself.

558

Seven save you, friends.

559

How can we help you?

560

What are you doing here?

561

Well, we're talking about life.

562

You?

563

Protecting the people.

564

Well, we thank you for your protection.

565

Who are you protecting us from?

566

Do you have any horses?

567

No horses.

568

No gold. No steel.

569

Food, then. Protecting the
people is hungry work.

570

I'm sure it is.

571

You're welcome to stay for supper,

572

but we have hungry mouths here.

573

Stay safe.

574

The night is dark and full of terrors.

575

"Seven save you, friends."

576

I'm a fucking septon. What
was I supposed to say?

577

They don't believe in your Seven.

578

They're from the Brotherhood.
They follow the Red God.

579

Aye, well, all are welcome here.

580

Anyway, we got nothing for them.

581

Sure, you do. You've got food,

582

you've got steel even
if you say you don't.

583

And you've got women.

584

What do you want to do? Fight them?

585

Kill them?

586

It'd be you against all of them.

587

I mean, these people
don't know how to fight.

588

You do.

589

I'm done with fighting.

590

Even if it's to protect yourself?

591

Violence is a disease.

592

You don't cure a disease by
spreading it to more people.

593

You don't cure it by dying, either.

594

You've done enough work for one day.

595

Come on up for some supper.

596

It's gonna be a cold night.

597

We'll need firewood.

598

I'll save you a bowl of stew.

599

Might even have some ale hidden away.

600

He's not a lying man.

601

He says the Iron Fleet's
in Slaver's Bay.

602

I'm inclined to believe him.

603

I'm not going anywhere
near those mad fuckers.

604

You're Westerosi.

605

What do you care?

606

I want to book passage home.

607

You? Can't afford it.

608

Where'd you steal this from?

609

Why do you care?

610

We leave in two days.

611

You can have a hammock in steerage.

612

I want a cabin.

613

And we'll leave at dawn.

614

See you at sunrise.

615

Sweet girl.

Give him another go, Ned.

That's my father.

And my Uncle Benjen.

40

Keep your shield up or I'll
ring your head like a bell.

They were all so happy.

42

So were you once.

Benjen:
Lyanna!

46

My Aunt Lyanna.

47

<i>I've seen her statue in the crypt.</i>

48

My father never talked about her.

49

Benjen: <i>Would you get out of here?
We're sparring.</i>

50

Who are you gonna spar with
when Ned goes off to the Eyrie?

Benjen:
<i>I don't know.</i>

What about him?

Wylis, come here.

54

Hodor?

55

Benjen: <i>But he's got giant's blood.</i>

56

And you've got training. Sounds
like a fair match to me.

57

Benjen always lifts his chin
when he's about to charge.

58

And lowers it when he's
going to dodge, my lady.

59

Hodor talks?

60

You leave the fighting
to the little lords, Wylis.

61

Come along, now.
It's no place for you.

62

Oh, Nan, look at the size of him.

63

If he ever learned to
fight, he'd be unstoppable.

64

Well, he's never going to learn to
fight because he's a stable boy.

65

So leave him be.

66

It is time to go.

67

Please, a little longer.

68

You finally show me
something I care about

71

and then you drag me away.

It is beautiful beneath the sea,

73

but if you stay too long,
you'll drown.

I wasn't drowning.
I was home.

What happened?

81

Hodor.

82

Where's Meera?

83

Hodor.

84

You shouldn't be here.

85

It's not safe outside the cave.

86

It's not safe anywhere.

87

I saw that Hodor wasn't always Hodor.

88

- Hodor.
- <i>His real name is Wylis.</i>

89

And he could talk and
fight and-- and then--

90

What's wrong?

91

The Three-Eyed Raven
says there's a war coming.

92

And we're going to fight it in there?

93



94

Brandon Stark needs you.

95

For what?
I sit in there

96

and I watch him have his visions
and nothing ever happens.

97

He isn't going to stay here forever.

98

And out there he needs you.

99

Open the door and the men inside

Right, so there she is,

129

tits and ass jiggling in the breeze.

130

All of a sudden she looks my way.

131

Gives me a little smile
like, "Well?"

132

So, all right, you know,
I've never been shy

133

and I'm blessed down south,
so I put it right out.

134

- 
- She's never seen anything like it.

135

I mean, she's used to her
brother and from what I hear,

136

Jaime Lannister's half
an inch shy of an inch.

137

Ooh!

138

She sees it and I swear to
the gods she licks her lips.

139



140

Well, you all know me.

141

You know I wouldn't lie about this.

142



143

144

<i>-

145

146

Get out of my way.

147

King's orders, Your Grace.

148

What are the king's orders?

149

He would like you to remain
in the Red Keep, Your Grace,

150

for your own protection.

151

You're barring me from attending
my own daughter's funeral?

152

Forgive me, Your Grace, by the king's
command, I cannot let you pass.

153

I would like to speak to my son.

154

He has left the Red Keep, Your Grace.

155



156

She grew up.

157

Jaime:
<i>Almost.</i>

158

Have we caught Prince
Trystane's killers?

159

I expect it was Mother.

160

Your mother wouldn't do that.

161

Yes, she would.

162

Are you angry with her?

163

- Of course not.
- Then why didn't you let her come?

164

She has every right to be here.

165

They told me she wouldn't
be allowed in the sept.

166

If she had tried--

167

They're not putting
your mother in a cell ever again.

168

Not while I'm here.

169

Why haven't you gone to see her?

170

Everything she endured,
she did it for you.

171

Don't you think I know that?

172

I'm sorry.

173

But I can't.

174

Why not?

175

When the Faith Militant
seized her and Margaery,

176

what did I do?

177

When they paraded her through
the streets like a whore,

178

what did I do?

179

We all fail sometimes.

180

The king is supposed to be
the Protector of the Realm.

181

If I can't even protect my
own wife or my own mother,

182

what good am I?

183

Go and see your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

184

Your Grace.

185

Lord Commander.

186

I want to see my wife.

187

The gods wait for Queen Margaery

188

to confess her crimes
and seek their mercy.

189

The king must wait as well.

190

Go and see your mother, Tommen.

191

You're a bold man.

192



193

On the contrary.

194

I fear a great deal.

195

The Father, the Mother,

196

the Warrior.

197

Do you know why we use these stones?

198

To remind us not to fear death.

199

We close our eyes on this world
and open them on the next.

200

You must long for the next life.

201

In truth, I fear that, too.

202

You imprisoned
and humiliated my sister.

203

Your sister sought the gods' mercy

204

and atoned for her sin.

205

What about my sins?

206

I broke a sacred oath and
stabbed my king in the back.

207

I killed my own cousin.

208

When the gods judged
my brother guilty,

209

I helped him escape their justice.

210

What atonement do I deserve?

211

You would spill blood
in this holy place?

212

Oh, the gods won't mind.

213

They've spilled more blood
than the rest of us combined.

214

Go on, then.

215

I deserve it.
We all do.

216

We are weak, vain creatures.

217

We live only by the Mother's mercy.

218



219

They should be closer if you
mean for them to save you.

220

I don't.

221

They'd never reach me
before you struck.

222

I've fought against worse odds.

223

No doubt many of us would fall.

224

But who are we, hmm?

225

We have no names, no family.

226

Every one of us
is poor and powerless.

227

And yet together,

228

we can overthrow an empire.

229



230

<i></i>

231

Tommen:
<i>Mother.</i>

232

Did they put her in the
red gown or the gold?

233

Gold.

234

Good. It was always her color.

235

I'm sorry for keeping you here.

236

<i>I shouldn't have,
but I was--</i>

237

I didn't want to lose you again.

238

I understand.

239

I'm glad to see you.

240

I know I should have come sooner.

241

I wanted to.
I was wrong.

242

It's all right.

243

No, it isn't.

244

I should have executed all of them.

245

I should have pulled down the sept

246

onto the High Sparrow's head
before I let them do that to you,

247

as you would have for me.

248

You raised me to be strong...

249

and I wasn't.

250

But I want to be.

251

Help me.

252

Always.

253

<i></i>

254

<i></i>

255



256

If I lost my cock,
I'd drink all the time.

257

Meaning no offense.

258

He makes dwarf jokes,
I make eunuch jokes.

259

I do not make dwarf jokes.

260

- You think them.
- 

261

So, the fleet.
It's been burned.

262

We are searching for the men who burned
the ships, but nobody saw anything.

263

Surely there's some good
news lurking somewhere.

264

Astapor and Yunkai have
stopped asking us for aid.

265

Perhaps they can
tell us their secret.

266

The Masters have retaken both cities.

267

Outside of Meereen, the whole of Slaver's
Bay has returned to the slavers.

268

What about the dragons? We have two
of them here beneath the pyramid.

269

They are not eating.

270

They haven't touched any food
since Queen Daenerys left.

271

Daenerys is the dragon queen.

272

Can't very well let the dragons
starve, that's obvious.

273

If a dragon does not want to eat,
how do you force him to eat?

274

Dragons do not do well in captivity.

275

- How do you know this?
- That's what I do.

276

I drink and I know things.

277

The dragons Aegon used
to conquer Westeros

278

ranged over hundreds of miles.

279

Then Daenerys's ancestors

280

started chaining them up in pens.

281

A few generations later,

282

the last dragons
were no larger than cats.

283

They must be unchained
or they'll waste away.

284

Missandei,

285

how many times were you in the
company of these dragons?

286

- Many times.
- And did they ever harm you?

287

Never.

288

Dragons are intelligent.

289

More intelligent than men
according to some maesters.

290

They have affection for their friends

291

and fury for their enemies.

292

- I am their friend.
- Do they know that?

293

They will. It's time
they had their supper.

294

296



297



298



299



300

I'm friends with your mother.

301



302

I'm here to help.

303

Don't eat the help.


304



305

When I was a child,

306

an uncle asked what gift
I wanted for my name day.

307

I begged him for one of you.

308

"It wouldn't even have to be
a big dragon," I told him.

309

"It could be little
like me."

310

Everyone laughed like it was the
funniest thing they had ever heard.

311

Then my father told me

312

the last dragon had died
a century ago.

313

I cried myself to sleep that night.

314

But here you are.

315



316



317

Next time I have an idea like that,

318

punch me in the face.

319

<i>-

What's your name?

322

323



324

<i></i>

325

What's your name?

326

- No one.
- I don't believe that.

327

- 
- You don't believe that.

328



329



330



331

Who are you?

332

No one.

333

If a girl says her name,

334

a man will let her sleep
under a roof tonight.

335

A girl has no name.

336

If a girl says her name,

337

a man will feed her tonight.

338

A girl has no name.

339

If a girl says her name,

340

a man will give her eyes back.

341

A girl has no name.

342

Come.

343

Leave it.

344

<i>A girl is not a beggar anymore.</i>

345

346

We came upon the bodies
on our way here.

347

Half a dozen men?
Your best hunters?

348

They obviously had help.

349

I didn't think Lady Sansa
killed them all by herself.

350

Thank you for this report,
Lord Karstark.

351

We know where she's going.

352

Her brother's at Castle Black.

353

Ned Stark's last surviving son?

354

Jon Snow is a bastard, not a Stark.

355

So was I, Father.

356

Your hold on the North
will never be secure

357

as long as a Stark
can walk through that door.

358

Castle Black isn't defended
on the southern side.

359

And the few men left are barely men at all.
Farm boys and thieves.

360

With a small force, we could storm
the castle, kill Jon Snow--

361

Murder the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch?

362

You'd unite every house
in the North against us.

363

We don't need
every house in the North.

364

<i>The Umbers, the Manderlys,
and the Karstarks</i>

365

command more soldiers than all
the other houses combined.

366

With their support,
none could challenge us.

367

The Starks lost my house the day
King Robb cut off my father's head.

368

It's time for new blood in the North.

369

If you acquire a
reputation as a mad dog,

370

you'll be treated as a mad dog.

371

Taken out back and
slaughtered for pig feed.

372

Maester:
<i>My lords.</i>

373

<i>Lady Walda has given birth.</i>

374

A boy.

<i>Red-cheeked

My congratulations, Lord Bolton.

377

Congratulations, Father.

378

I look forward to meeting
my new brother.

How did he die?

387

Poisoned by his enemies.

388

You're talking to your lord.
Use respect.

389

Forgive me, my lord.

390

Send for Lady Walda and the baby.

May I hold him?

397

Of-- of course.

398

Little brother.

399

Lord Bolton sent for us.

400

Have you seen him?

401

Of course.
Follow me, Mother.

Brienne:
<i>I saw her with a man.</i>

426

I don't think he hurt her.

427

She didn't want to leave him,
he didn't want to leave her.

428

You don't know which way she went?

429

I spent three days looking for her.

430

She disappeared.

431

How'd she look?

432

She looked good.

433

She wasn't exactly
dressed like a lady.

434

No, she wouldn't be.

435

What happened at Winterfell?

436

I should have gone with you
while I had the chance.

437

It was a difficult choice, my lady.

438

We've all had to make
difficult choices.

439

<i>-

440

We shouldn't be lighting fires.

441

It's not safe.

442

He won't stop hunting us.

443

We just have to make it
to Castle Black.

444

Once we're with Jon, Ramsay
won't be able to touch us.

445

Jon will have me killed the
moment I step through the gate.

446

I won't let him.

447

I'll tell him the truth
about Bran and Rickon.

448

And the truth about the farm
boys I killed in their place.

449

And the truth about
Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded.

450

And the truth about Robb,
who I betrayed.

451

When you take the black,
all your crimes are forgiven.

452

I don't want to be forgiven.

453

I can never make
amends to your family

454

for the things I've done.

455

They'll keep you safer
than I ever could.

456

You're not coming with us?

457

I would have taken you
all the way to the Wall.

458

I would have died to get you there.

459



460

May I take one of the horses?

461

Where will you go?

462

Home.

464

Yara: <i>The Glovers have
retaken Deepwood Motte.</i>

465

And the ironborn who held it?

466

They died fighting to a man.

467

What is dead may never die.

468

What is dead may never die.

469

But they did

470

and our invasion died with them.

471

Deepwood Motte was our last
stronghold on the mainland.

472

Then we will take more.

473

Why? For more pinecones and rocks?

474

Because I order it.

475

We can defeat anyone at sea,

476

but we'll never hold
lands and castles

477

against mainland armies.

478

Not if our captains defy my orders,

479

abandon their posts, and sacrifice
our men on foolish missions.

480

I won't apologize
for trying to rescue Theon.

481

Then where is he?

482

Where is your kingdom?

483

We took those castles because the
northerners marched off to war.

484

That war is over.

485

The last time
we provoked them too far,

486

I watched from that window
as they breached our walls

487

<i>and knocked down our towers.</i>

488

<i>I lost two brothers that day.</i>

489

And I lost three sons.

490

The War of the Five
Kings, they call it.

491

Well, the other four are dead.

492

When you rule the Iron Islands, you
can wage all the peace you want.

493

But for now, shut your mouth and obey

494

or I will make another heir who will.

495

<i></i>

496



497

Let me pass.

498

You fool, move aside for your king.

499

Haven't I always, brother?

500

I thought you'd be rotting
under some foreign sea by now.

501

What is dead may never die.

502

Has the custom changed
since I've been gone?

503

Aren't you supposed
to repeat the words?

504

You can mock our god without my help.

505

I don't mock the Drowned God.

506

I am the Drowned God.

507

From Oldtown to Qarth,

508

when men see my sails, they pray.

509



510


You're old, brother.

511

<i>You've had your time.</i>

512

Now let another rule.

513

I heard you lost your mind

514

during a storm on the Jade Sea.

515

They tied you to the mast to
keep you from jumping overboard.

516

They did.

517

And when the storm passed,
you cut out their tongues.

518

I needed silence.

519

What kind of an ironborn

520

loses his senses during a storm?

521

I am the storm, brother.

522

The first storm and the last.

523

And you're in my way.

524



525

<i></i>

526

Lord, take your servant Balon
back beneath the waves.

527

Feed the creatures of your
kingdom on his flesh.

528

Pull his bones down to your depths

529

to rest beside his ancestors
and his children.

530

All: What is dead may never die.

531

I'm going to find out who did this.

532

I'm going to feed them to
the sharks while they live.

533

I swear it by the Salt Throne.

534

The Salt Throne is not
yours to swear upon,

535

not unless the kingsmoot chooses you.

536

My father would have
wanted me to rule.

537

Your father does not get to choose.
The law is clear.

538

Perhaps you'll win.

539

Perhaps you'll be the first woman
in history to rule the ironborn.

540

And perhaps not.

541

<i></i>

542

Come in.

543

I'm sorry, my lady.
Didn't mean to interrupt.

544

You interrupt nothing.

545

I assume you know why I'm here.

546

I will after you tell me.

547

It's about the Lord Commander.

548

The former Lord Commander.

549

Does he have to be?

550

What are you asking?

551

Do you know of any magic...

552

that could help him?

553

Bring him back?

554

If you want to help him,
leave him be.

555

Can it be done?

556

There are some with this power.

557

- <i>How?</i>
- I don't know.

558

Have you seen it done?

559

I met a man who came
back from the dead,

560

but the priest
who did it--

561

it shouldn't have been possible.

562

But it was.
It could be now.

563

Not for me.

564

Not for you?

565

I saw you drink poison that
should have killed you.

566

I saw you give birth
to a demon made of shadows.

567

Everything I believed,

568

the great victory
I saw in the flames,

569

all of it was a lie.

570

You were right all along.

571

The Lord never spoke to me.

572

Fuck him, then.

573

Fuck all of them.

574

I'm not a devout man, obviously.

575

Seven gods, drowned gods,
tree gods, it's all the same.

576

I'm not asking the Lord
of Light for help.

577

I'm asking the woman who
showed me that miracles exist.

578

I never had this gift.

579

Have you ever tried?

580



581



582



583



584

Weak men will never rule Dorne again.

2

Riverrun is ours.

3

You let the Blackfish take it from you.

4

Take that castle back.

5

He'll never yield, father.

6

You'll remind him who
it was that got married

7

at the Red Wedding in the first place.

8

Command all the forces within the castle

9

to lay down their arms. Open the gates.

10

Your aunt Lyanna...

11

She was already promised
to Robert Baratheon.

12

Father never talked about her.

13

How many tens of thousands had to die

14

because Rhaegar chose your aunt.

15

And then he kidnapped her and raped her.

16

We need friends in Westeros,
and we need ships.

17

I hope you're right about
this expedition of yours.

18

If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

19

Our fathers were evil men.

20

They left the world worse
than they found it.

21

We're going to leave the world
better than we found it.

22

Your reign is over.

23

My reign has just begun.

24

You've made great progress.

25

I only pray your grandmother
follows your lead,

26

or I fear for her safety.

27

Go home. Find comfort in
prayer and good works.

28

The Mother watches over us all.

29

After conferring with His
Holiness, the High Septon,

30

we have determined that trial by combat

31

will be forbidden throughout
the Seven Kingdoms.

32

Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell

33

will stand trial before seven septons

34

as it was in the earliest
days of the faith.

35

Your Grace.

36

The trial will be
getting under way soon.

37

You got my money?

38

Later. Go away.

39

Grand Maester.

40

Ser Loras Tyrell.

41

Are you prepared to stand trial

42

and profess your guilt or
innocence before the Seven?

43

There'll be no need for a trial.

44

I confess before the Seven

45

and freely admit to my crimes.

46

To which crimes will you be confessing?

47

All of them.

48

I lay with other men

49

including the traitor Renly Baratheon.

50

I perjured myself before the gods.

51

I am guilty of depravity...

52

dishonesty,

53

profligacy,

54

and arrogance.

55

I see that now.

56

I humble myself before the Seven

57

and accept whatever punishment
the gods deem just.

58

The gods' judgment is fierce,

59

but also fair.

60

The Warrior punishes those
who believe themselves

61

beyond the reach of justice.

62

But the Mother shows her mercy

63

to those who kneel before her.

64

I take full responsibility
for my many sins

65

and unburden myself of my desires.

66

My only remaining wish

67

is to devote my life to the Seven.

68

May I be a living example of their grace

69

for others to witness.

70

You understand fully

71

what this means?

72

I do.

73

I will abandon the Tyrell name

74

and all that goes with it.

75

I will renounce my lordship
and my claims on Highgarden.

76

I will never marry

77

and I will never father children.

78

Brother Loras...

79

...I ask you to dedicate
your life to the seven gods.

80

Will you fight to defend your faith

81

against heretics and apostates?

82

I will.

83

No, I can't let them...

84

Faith is the way, Father.

85

All right.

86

I'm ready.

87

I have to go. I'm...

88

I'm late for the trial.

89

You mutilated him.

90

You gave me your word.

91

And I have kept my word.

92

Once the queen mother's
trial is concluded,

93

Brother Loras is free to leave.

94

And where is the queen mother?

95

Her litter never left the Red Keep.

96

It appears the queen mother doesn't
wish to attend her own trial.

97

Go to the Red Keep and show her the way.

98

Get the others.

99

Where's the king?

100

Elsewhere, I'm afraid.

101

What's the meaning of this?

102

I was told that...

103

I have more important
things to do with my time

104

than waste them in the presence...

105

Please, Grand Maester. I
bear you no ill will.

106

Please forgive me if you can.

107

This pains me, my lord.

108

Whatever your faults, you do not deserve

109

to die alone in such a cold, dark place.

110

But sometimes before we
can usher in the new,

111

the old must be put to rest.

112

The longer you wait, the
worse it'll be for you.

113

What are you doing?

114

There's something wrong.

115

You have nothing to fear, Your Grace.

116

The trial will begin shortly.

117

Cersei is not here. Tommen is not here.

118

Why do you think they're not here?

119

If the accused is not here,

120

she will be tried regardless.

121

We cannot escape the
justice of the gods...

122

Forget about the bloody gods and
listen to what I'm telling you!

123

Cersei understands the
consequences of her absence

124

and she is absent anyway,

125

which means she does not intend
to suffer those consequences.

126

The trial can wait.
We all need to leave.

127

We all need to leave now!

128

Loras.

129

Stay with me.

130

Let me through. Let me through.

131

Get out of my way.

132

Let us through.

133

Confess.

134

Confess.

135

- No.
- Confess.

136

Confess. It felt good.

137

Beating me, starving me,

138

frightening me, humiliating me.

139

You didn't do it because you
cared about my atonement.

140

You did it because it felt good.

141

I understand.

142

I do things because they feel good.

143

I drink because it feels good.

144

I killed my husband because it
felt good to be rid of him.

145

I fuck my brother because it feels
good to feel him inside me.

146

I lie about fucking my brother...

147

because it feels good to keep our
son safe from hateful hypocrites.

148

I killed your High Sparrow...

149

and all his little sparrows...

150

all his septons, all his septas,

151

all his filthy soldiers,

152

because it felt good to watch them burn.

153

It felt good to imagine
their shock and their pain.

154

No thought has ever
given me greater joy.

155

Even confessing feels good
under the right circumstances.

156

You've always been quiet.

157

I said my face would be the last
thing you saw before you died.

158

Do you remember?

159

Good.

160

I'm glad to see your face.

161

I'm ready to meet the gods.

162

What?

163

Now?

164

Today?

165

You're not going to die today.

166

You're not going to die
for quite a while.

167

Ser Gregor.

168

This is Ser Gregor Clegane.

169

He's quiet, too.

170

Your gods have forsaken you.

171

This is your god now.

172

No.

173

No.

174

Shame.

175

Shame.

176

Shame.

177

I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

178

Very sorry.

179

For House Lannister!

180

Hear me roar!

181

For House Frey!

182

We stand together!

183

May we stand together
through the centuries,

184

good friends to the last.

185

And when we drive our swords
through our enemies' hearts,

186

may we speak the words of our alliance,

187

"The Freys and the Lannisters

188

send their regards."

189

You don't even have to
do anything, do you?

190

You just sit there, a rich slab of beef,

191

and all the birds come pecking.

192

- You're welcome to her.
- She doesn't want me.

193

She wants your golden
fingers up her twat.

194

Those two have their eyes on you.

195

They have their eyes on you, cunt.

196

Not my type.

197

Not blonde enough?

198

Ladies, have you met Ser
Bronn of the Blackwater,

199

hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay?

200

- There you go.
- Maybe I'm not in the mood.

201

Fuck it.

202

No need to call me ser just
because I'm an anointed knight.

203

This came together rather well.

204

Your father would be pleased.

205

I'm sure he would be.

206

Edmure is back in a cell.

207

Can't go killing my son by law.
It wouldn't be right.

208

Give the family a bad name.

209

So the famous Blackfish
killed by foot soldiers, eh?

210

Legendary warrior, everyone said.

211

Have you done much fighting
yourself, Lord Frey?

212

I'm a bit old for all that.

213

No, but back in your day.

214

The purpose of fighting

215

is defeating your enemies, isn't it?

216

I've defeated mine.

217

Riverrun belonged to House
Tully for a thousand years.

218

Now it's mine.

219

What do you call that?

220

Victory.

221

Yes, you're a great conqueror.

222

Go on, mock me, boy. You think I mind?

223

The Tullys mocked me for years.

224

The Starks mocked me.

225

Where are they now?

226

You talk about war as
if you're an expert,

227

but the one battle I
remember you fighting,

228

you were captured by Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

229

But it doesn't matter.

230

Here we are now, two kingslayers.

231

We know what it's like to
have them grovel to our faces

232

and snigger behind our backs.

233

We don't mind, do we?

234

Fear is a marvelous thing.

235

They don't fear the Freys, though.

236

They fear the Lannisters.

237

We gave you the Riverlands
to hold the Riverlands.

238

If we have to ride north
and take them back for you

239

every time you lose them,

240

why do we need you?

241

Show me.

242

Your Grace, there's no need...

243

Show me.

244

What are your thoughts
concerning the king's funeral?

245

As the Sept of Baelor
is no longer an option,

246

perhaps a ceremony in the throne room?

247

He should be with his grandfather,

248

his brother, his sister.

249

Burn him

250

and bury his ashes where
the sept once stood.

251

Hello.

252

From Lord Commander
Snow at Castle Black.

253

I'm...

254

I'm to be the new maester.

255

According to our records,

256

Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander.

257

He died.

258

We received no report from
the maester at Castle Black.

259

Maester Aemon became quite ill
shortly after the election.

260

He's since passed away.

261

Jon Snow will go to

262

Which is why I'm here.

263

This is irregular.

264

Yes, well...

265

I suppose that life is irregular.

266

The archmaester will discuss
these irregularities with you.

267

In the meantime, you are
permitted to use the library.

268

Follow me.

269

No women or children.

270

When we had feasts,

271

our family would sit up here...

272

and I'd sit down there.

273

Could have been worse, Jon Snow.

274

You had a family.

275

You had feasts.

276

Aye, you're right. I
was luckier than most.

277

What is that?

278

Tell him.

279

Tell him who it belonged to.

280

The Princess Shireen.

281

Tell him what you did to her.

282

Tell him!

283

We burned her at the stake.

284

Why?

285

The army was trapped.
The horses were dying.

286

- It was the only way.
- You burned a little girl alive!

287

I only do what my Lord commands.

288

If he commands you to burn
children, your Lord is evil.

289

We are standing here because of him.

290

Jon Snow is alive because
the Lord willed it.

291

I loved that girl like she was my own.

292

She was good. She was kind.
And you killed her!

293

So did her father.

294

So did her mother.

295

Her own blood knew it was the only way.

296

The only way for what?

297

They all died anyway.

298

You told everyone Stannis was the one.

299

You had him believing
it, all of them fooled.

300

- And you lied.
- I didn't lie.

301

I was wrong.

302

Aye, you were wrong.

303

How many died because you were wrong?

304

I ask your leave to execute
this woman for murder.

305

She admits to the crime.

306

Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

307

I've been ready to die for many years.

308

If the Lord was done with
me, so be it, but he's not.

309

You've seen the Night King, Jon Snow.

310

You know the great war is still to come.

311

You know the army of the
dead will be upon us soon.

312

And you know I can
help you win that war.

313

Ride south today.

314

If you return to the North,

315

I'll have you hanged as a murderer.

316

If you ever come back this way,

317

I will execute you myself.

318

I'm having the lord's
chamber prepared for you.

319

Mother and Father's room?

320

You should take it.

321

I'm not a Stark.

322

You are to me.

323

You're the Lady of Winterfell.

324

You deserve it. We're
standing here because of you.

325

The battle was lost until the
Knights of the Vale rode in.

326

They came because of you.

327

You told me Lord Baelish
sold you to the Boltons.

328

- He did.
- And you trust him?

329

Only a fool would trust Littlefinger.

330

I should have told you about him,

331

about the Knights of the Vale.

332

I'm sorry.

333

We need to trust each other.

334

We can't fight a war amongst ourselves.

335

We have so many enemies now.

336

Jon.

337

A raven came from the Citadel.

338

A white raven.

339

Winter is here.

340

Well, Father always promised, didn't he?

341

The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne,

342

he was assassinated.

343

100 red scorpions, was it?

344

You have nothing to fear
from us, Lady Olenna.

345

You murder your own prince,

346

but you expect me to trust you?

347

We invited you to Dorne
because we needed your help.

348

You came to Dorne because
you needed our help.

349

What is your name again?

350

Barbaro?

351

Obara.

352

Obara. You look like
an angry little boy.

353

Don't presume to tell me what I need.

354

Forgive my sister. What she
lacks in diplomacy, she makes...

355

Do shut up, dear. Anything from you?

356

No? Good.

357

Let the grown women speak.

358

The Lannisters have declared
war on House Tyrell.

359

They have declared war on Dorne.

360

We must be allies now
if we wish to survive.

361

Cersei stole the future from me.

362

She killed my son.

363

She killed my grandson.

364

She killed my granddaughter.

365

Survival is not what I'm after now.

366

You're absolutely right.

367

I chose the wrong words.

368

It is not survival I offer.

369

It is your heart's desire.

370

And what is my heart's desire?

371

Vengeance.

372

Justice.

373

Fire and blood.

374

Your ships are nearly ready.

375

I saw them painting the sails.

376

!T!U!S!U!B!T!I!T!U!L!O!C!O!M!

377

I'm curious to see how the
Dothraki do on the poison water.

378

You're not coming with us.

379

New strategy?

380

You want the Second Sons to
attack from the west coast?

381

If we take Casterly Rock,

382

the Lannisters will have nowhere to
run when you hit King's Landing.

383

You're not going to Westeros.

384

You're staying here
with the Second Sons.

385

There's finally peace in Meereen.

386

You will keep the peace while the
people choose their own leaders.

387

Fuck Meereen.

388

Fuck the people.

389

I'm here for you, not them.

390

You promised me.

391

"My sword is yours. My life is yours."

392

This is what I command.

393

If I'm going to rule in Westeros,

394

I'll need to make alliances.

395

The best way to make
alliances is with marriage.

396

Who are you marrying this time?

397

I don't know. Maybe no one.

398

But you need to lure all the
noble houses to the table?

399

Are you a queen or fish bait?

400

I can't bring a lover to Westeros.

401

A king wouldn't think twice about it.

402

So that's what you want?
To be my mistress?

403

I'm not proud. I don't care
what perfumed aristocrat

404

sits beside you in the throne room.

405

I don't want a crown. I want you.

406

I love you.

407

And I make you happy.

408

You know I do.

409

Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.

410

I can't.

411

The dwarf told you to do this?

412

No one tells me to do anything.

413

Clever fellow. Can't
argue with his logic.

414

I'm no use to you over there.

415

Don't get angry.

416

I'm not angry. I'm full of self-pity.

417

Who comes after you?

418

Who can ever follow Daenerys
Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?

419

A great number of women, I imagine.

420

Specific orders will be left for you

421

regarding the welfare of Meereen
and the Bay of Dragons.

422

Bay of Dragons?

423

We can't call it Slaver's
Bay anymore, can we?

424

You'll get that throne you
want so badly, I'm sure of it.

425

I hope it brings you happiness.

426

I pity the lords of Westeros.

427

They have no idea
what's coming for them.

428

Farewell, Daario Naharis.

429

How did he take it?

430

No tears.

431

I know it was hard for you.

432

You turned away a man
who truly loves you

433

because he would have been a
liability in the Seven Kingdoms.

434

That's the kind of self-sacrifice
that makes for a good ruler,

435

if it's any consolation.

436

It's not.

437

No, I suppose not.

438

I'm terrible at consoling.

439

Yes, you really are.

440

All right, how about the fact
that this is actually happening?

441

You have your armies,
you have your ships,

442

you have your dragons.

443

Everything you've ever wanted

444

since you were old
enough to want anything,

445

it's all yours for the taking.

446

Are you afraid?

447

Good.

448

You're in the great game now.

449

And the great game's terrifying.

450

The only people who
aren't afraid of failure

451

are madmen like your father.

452

Do you know what frightens me?

453

I said farewell to a man who loves me.

454

A man I thought I cared for.

455

And I felt nothing.

456

Just impatient to get on with it.

457

He wasn't the first to love you

458

and he won't be the last.

459

Well, you have completely
failed to console me.

460

For what it's worth, I've been a cynic
for as long as I can remember.

461

Everyone's always asking
me to believe in things...

462

family, gods, kings, myself.

463

It was often tempting

464

until I saw where belief got people.

465

So I said no, thank you to belief.

466

And yet here I am.

467

I believe in you.

468

It's embarrassing, really.

469

I'd swear you my sword,

470

but I don't actually own a sword.

471

It's your counsel I need.

472

It's yours.

473

Now and always.

474

Good.

475

I...

476

I had something made for you.

477

I'm not sure if it's right.

478

Tyrion Lannister,

479

I name you Hand of the Queen.

480

You're not one of mine, are you?

481

No, my lord.

482

Didn't think so.

483

Too pretty.

484

Where are my damn moron sons?!

485

Black Walder and Lothar
promised to be here by midday.

486

They're here, my lord.

487

Well, what are they doing,
trimming their cunt hairs?

488

Tell them to come here now.

489

But they're already here, my lord.

490

Here, my lord.

491

They weren't easy to carve.

492

Especially Black Walder.

493

What...

494

My name is Arya Stark.

495

I want you to know that.

496

The last thing you're ever going to see

497

is a Stark smiling down
at you as you die.

498

Forgive me, my lady...

499

if you're at prayer.

500

I'm done with all that.

501

I came here every day when I was a girl.

502

I prayed to be somewhere else.

503

Back then I only thought about what I
wanted, never about what I had.

504

I was a stupid girl.

505

You were a child.

506

What do you want?

507

I thought you knew what I wanted.

508

I was wrong.

509

No, you weren't.

510

Every time I'm faced with a decision,

511

I close my eyes and
see the same picture.

512

Whenever I consider an
action, I ask myself

513

will this action help to
make this picture a reality?

514

Pull it out of my mind

515

and into the world?

516

And I only act if the answer is yes.

517

A picture of me...

518

on the Iron Throne...

519

and you by my side.

520

It's a pretty picture.

521

News of this battle will spread
quickly through the Seven Kingdoms.

522

I've declared for House
Stark for all to hear.

523

You've declared for other
houses before, Lord Baelish.

524

It's never stopped you
from serving yourself.

525

The past is gone for good.

526

You can sit here mourning its departure

527

or you can prepare for the future.

528

You, my love,

529

are the future of House Stark.

530

Who should the North rally behind?

531

A trueborn daughter of
Ned and Catelyn Stark

532

born here at Winterfell

533

or a motherless bastard
born in the south?

534

This is where I leave you.

535

You're not coming with us?

536

The Wall is not just ice and stone.

537

Ancient spells were carved
into its foundations.

538

Strong magic

539

to protect men from what lies beyond.

540

And while it stands,
the dead cannot pass.

541

I cannot pass.

542

Where will you go?

543

The great war is coming

544

and I still fight for the living.

545

I'll do what I can...

546

as long as I can.

547

Thank you, Uncle Benjen.

548

I wish you both good fortune.

549

Are you sure you're ready for this?

550

I'm the Three-Eyed Raven now.

551

I have to be ready for this.

552

Ned?

553

Lyanna.

554

Is that you?

555

Is that really you?

556

You're not a dream?

557

No, I'm not a dream.

558

I'm here.

559

Right here.

560

I've missed you, big brother.

561

I've missed you, too.

562

I want to be brave.

563

You are.

564

I'm not.

565

I don't want to die.

566

You're not going to die.

567

Get her some water!

568

- No, no water.
- Is there a maester?

569

Listen to me, Ned.

570

_

571

If Robert finds out, he'll...

572

you know he will.

573

You have to protect him.

574

Promise me, Ned.

575

Promise me.

576

Promise me, Ned.

577

Promise me.

578

You can't expect Knights of the Vale

579

to side with wildling invaders.

580

We didn't invade. We were invited.

581

Not by me.

582

The free folk, the northerners,

583

and the Knights of the
Vale fought bravely,

584

fought together, and we won.

585

My father used to say we find our
true friends on the battlefield.

586

The Boltons are defeated.

587

The war is over.

588

Winter has come.

589

If the maesters are right, it'll be
the coldest one in a thousand years.

590

We should ride home and
wait out the coming storms.

591

The war is not over.

592

And I promise you, friend,

593

the true enemy won't wait out the storm.

594

He brings the storm.

595

Your son was butchered at the
Red Wedding, Lord Manderly,

596

but you refused the call.

597

You swore allegiance to
House Stark, Lord Glover,

598

but in their hour of greatest need,

599

you refused the call.

600

And you, Lord Cerwyn,

601

your father was skinned
alive by Ramsay Bolton.

602

Still you refused the call.

603

But House Mormont remembers.

604

The North remembers.

605

We know no king but the King in
the North whose name is Stark.

606

I don't care if he's a bastard.

607

Ned Stark's blood runs
through his veins.

608

He's my king from this
day until his last day.

609

Lady Mormont speaks harshly

610

and truly.

611

My son died for Robb
Stark, the Young Wolf.

612

I didn't think we'd find
another king in my lifetime.

613

I didn't commit my men to your cause

614

'cause I didn't want more
Manderlys dying for nothing.

615

But I was wrong.

616

Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding.

617

He is the White Wolf.

618

The King in the North.

619

I did not fight beside you on the field

620

and I will regret that
until my dying day.

621

A man can only admit when he was wrong

622

and ask forgiveness.

623

There's nothing to forgive, my lord.

624

There will be more fights to come.

625

House Glover will stand
behind House Stark

626

as we have for a thousand years.

627

And I will stand behind Jon Snow...

628

the King in the North!

629

The King in the North!

630

The King in the North!
The King in the North!

631

Company halt!

632

Halt!

633

Halt!

634

Come on.

635

I now proclaim Cersei
of the House Lannister

636

First of Her Name,

637

Queen of the Andals and the First Men,

638

Protector of the Seven Kingdoms.

639

Long may she reign.

640

Long may she reign.

- Sansa: Yes?
- <i></i>

5

For you, my lady.

6

How far is Mole's Town?

7

<i></i>

8

Sansa.

9

Lady Brienne.

10

When I heard you had escaped
Winterfell, I feared the worst.

11

You have no idea how happy I am

12

to see you unharmed.

13

Unharmed?

14

What are you doing here?

15

I rode north with the Knights of
the Vale to come to your aid.

16

<i>They're encamped
at Moat Cailin as we speak.</i>

17

To come to my aid?

18

Did you know about Ramsay?

19

If you didn't know, you're an idiot.

20

If you did know, you're my enemy.

21

Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

22

He never hurt my face.

23

He needed my face, the face
of Ned Stark's daughter.

24

But the rest of me,

25

he did what he liked
with the rest of me

26

<i>as long as I could
still give him an heir.</i>

27

What do you think he did?

28

I can't begin
to contemplate--

29

What do you think he did to me?

30

Lady Sansa asked you a question.

31

He beat you.

32

Yes, he enjoyed that.

33

What else do you think he did?

34

- Sansa, I--
- What else?

35

Did he cut you?

36

- Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.
- I didn't know.

37

I thought you knew
everyone's secrets.

38

I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.

39

I underestimated a stranger.

40

The other things he did,

41

ladies aren't supposed
to talk about those things,

42

but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

43

I can still feel it.

44

I don't mean in my tender
heart it still pains me so.

45

I can still feel what he did in
my body standing here right now.

46

I'm so sorry.

47

You said you would protect me.

48

And I will. You must believe me
when I tell you that I will.

49

I don't believe you anymore.
I don't need you anymore.

50

You can't protect me.

51

You won't even be able
to protect yourself

52

if I tell Brienne to cut you down.

53

And why shouldn't I?

54

Do you want me to beg for my life?

55

If that's what you want, I will.

56

Whatever you ask that is in my power,

57

I will do.

58

What if I want you
to die here and now?

59

Then I will die.

60

You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family

61

and you gave me to other
monsters who murdered my family.

62

<i>Go back to Moat Cailin.</i>

63

My brother and I will take
back the North on our own.

64

I never want to see you again.

65

I would do anything to undo
what's been done to you.

66

I know that I can't.

67

Will you allow me to say
one more thing before I go?

68

<i>Your great-uncle
Brynden the Blackfish</i>

69

has gathered what remains of the
Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

70

You might consider seeking him out.

71

The time may come when you
need an army loyal to you.

72

I have an army.

73

Your brother's army.

74

Half-brother.

75

<i></i>

76



77

You're not ready.

78

You should go home
before it's too late.

79



80



81



82

You'll never be
one of us, Lady Stark.

83

She has a point.

84

None of the first Faceless Men
were born to lords and ladies.

85

They began as slaves
in the mines of Valyria.

86

Who was the first?

87

He was no one.

88

The Many-Faced God taught
him how to shed his face

89

and how to give the gift.

90

The man taught others in
exchange for their service.

91

Many served, many more
gifts were given.

92

Soon all the masters
and overseers were gone

93

and the Faceless Men fled.

94

Where did they go?

95

Here.

96

They founded the Free City of
Braavos and built this house.

97

These were the faces
they wore in life

98

when they were not wearing others.

99

The first Faceless Men.

100

And now a girl is one of them,

101

if a girl desires.

102

A girl has no desires.

103

Who?

104

<i>An actress who calls
herself Lady Crane.</i>

105

She performs at the theater
in Sheelba Square.

106

<i>A girl has been given
a second chance.</i>

107

There will not be a third.

108

One way or another,

109

a face will be added to the hall.

110

<i></i>

111

<i></i>

112



113

- 
- Ahh!

114

Oh, murdered by a boar.

115

The great big hairy whore.

116

He dug in his tusks
and dug out my guts

117

and soon I am no more.

118

Oh, come, Father,
in bed you must lie.

119

I love you, Father.
Please don't die.

120

- Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.
- 

121

I feel the winds of winter
as they lick across the land.

122

And our son alone
on that cold, cold throne

123

without a guiding hand.

124

Who will teach him strength?
Who will teach him grace?

125

To whom will he turn when it's time to
learn to look darkness in the face?

126

Ned Stark will do fine.
Now bring me more wine.

127

<i>- 
- </i>

128

Ooh!

129

Ooh, what's happened here, then?

130

He brought you here, Ned Stark,

131

'cause you're the brightest
fellow in the land.

132

You should be king of us all

133

and I should be your Hand.

134

We men of the North
are right good hands

135

at keeping people lawful.

136

I'd ask him for permission,

137

but he smells too bloody awful.

138

- 
- <i></i>

139

<i>I die! I die!</i>

140

And here I now must lie.

141

Oh, woe.
Oh, no.

142

- 
- 

143

Oh, I am about to go.

144



145

Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?

146

The Iron Throne's what I demand.

147

- You cannot.
- I can.

148

- You will not.
- I will.

149

- You dare not.
- I dare yes.

150

<i>- The line of succession.
- What's that mean?</i>

151

<i>- The proper progression.
- What's that mean?</i>

152

- The lawful ascension.
- What's that mean?

153



154

- <i></i>
- 

155

So move along, give me my chair

156

and there won't be no more trouble.

157

- <i></i>

158

But we had a deal
all done and dusted.

159

I'm starting to think
you can't be trusted.

160

<i></i>

161

Save my father.

162

Truly you should. Killing the
man will do you no good.

163

- Save him, please.
- Show him mercy.

164

<i>Show the people what
a good king should be.</i>

Good people, you may all relax.

Tyrion actor:
<i>Worry not!</i>

<i>All is well.</i>

173

I have here a decree

174

from my father Tywin Lannister,

175

the richest man you'll see.

176

He proclaims me Hand of the King.

177

The position's mine for life.

178

And he's given me permission to take

179

Sansa as my wife.

184

and go rehearse our wedding night.

186

It's a wart.
Two warts.

187

I've got two fucking
warts on my cock.

188

Well, don't worry, love. They usually
go away in five or six years.

189

Oh, wash this, darling.
It stinks of me.

190

You can do better, Bianca, dear.
You must do.

191

I had two lines.

192

There are no small parts.
You rang very false.

193

I rang very false?

194

What you need, love, is for
someone to ring you true.

195



196

Bianca: You weren't complaining
about me last night.

197

Tyrion actor: <i>May I get you
some wine, Lady Crane?</i>

198

Lady Crane:
<i>I'm a rum girl, Bobono.</i>

199

You need to know that if
we're going to be intimate.

200

Of course we're going to be intimate.

201

It's only a matter of time.

202

<i></i>

203

To our children.

204

May they have your talent.

205

And your filthy mind.

206



207

A girl will poison the rum.

208

Lady Crane is the only
one who drinks it.

209

If a girl could use one of
the faces from the hall...

210

A girl is not ready.

211

She's a good actress.

212

So a man has heard.

213

Seems like a decent woman.

214

Does death only come for the wicked
and leave the decent behind?

215

No.

216

Who wants her dead?

217

That does not matter.
The price was paid.

218

The younger actress.

219

She's jealous because
Lady Crane is better.

220

A girl must decide if she wants
to serve the Many-Faced God.

221

A girl has decided.

222

A servant does not ask questions.

233



234

It was you.

235

You made the white walkers.

236

We were at war.

237

<i>We were being slaughtered.</i>

238

<i>Our sacred trees cut down.</i>

239

We needed to defend ourselves.

240

From whom?

241

From you.

242

From men.

243

Aeron: We speak in the
presence of the Drowned God.

244

In his name we gather today

245

to choose a new king as our leader.

246

Who makes a claim?

247

I am Yara Greyjoy,

248

daughter of Balon Greyjoy,

249

King of the Iron Islands.

250

I claim the Salt Throne.

251

We've never had a queen.
Not once.

252

There are many things
we've never done.

253

We've never made our mark
upon the world.

254

The great lords of
Westeros pay us no mind

255

until our little raids
buzz through their kingdoms

256

<i>long enough to become a nuisance.</i>

257

Then they swat us down.

258

They conquer us, humiliate us,

259

<i>and go right back
to forgetting we exist.</i>

260

Men:
Aye!

261

- We are a sea people.
- Aye!

262

- Our god is a sea god.
- Aye!

263

When I am queen, we will
build a fleet that--

264

- You shall not be queen!
- I am not finished!

265

Yes, you are!
A woman will not lead us.

266

Not when Balon's
own male heir has returned.

267

I am Theon Greyjoy...

268

last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

269

And she is your rightful ruler.

270

Men:
Aye!

271

Those of you that have
sailed under her,

272

and there are many of you here,

273

- <i>you know what she is.</i>
- Aye!

274

- She is a reaver.
- Aye!

275

- She is a warrior.
- Aye!

276

She is ironborn!

277

Aye!

278

We will find no better leader.

279

This is our queen.

<i></i>

281

<i>
Yara! Yara! Yara!</i>

282

I'm Euron Greyjoy.

283

I claim the Salt Throne.

284



285

Niece.

286

Nephew.

287

Little Theon.

288

Heard you managed to fuck
things right into the ground.

289



290

<i>Captured a castle you couldn't keep.</i>

291

Got yourself taken prisoner.

292

Even heard you have no cock.

293



294

Explains why you think
a woman can be king.

295

When did you return, Uncle?

296

A few days ago.

297

I had some things to take care of.

298

Long overdue.

299

I'm glad you're here.

300

Now I know what my first
act as queen will be.

301

To execute the man
who killed my father.

302



303

I did.

304

I killed him.

305

Threw him right over a rope bridge

306

and watched him fall.

307

<i>He was leading us nowhere</i>

308

and we would still be heading
there if it weren't for me.

309

<i>No one loved him.
No one wanted to follow him.</i>

310

He led us into two wars
we couldn't win.

311

I apologize to you all for
not killing him years ago.

312

That would have been hard to do.

313

You weren't here.

314

Last I heard, you were gallivanting
around the world having a grand old time.

315

Gallivanting?

316

That the sort of thing
you start to say

317

- once your dick gets chopped off?
- 

318

<i>Did the great lords of Westeros
teach you words like that?</i>

319

You were gone.

320

Yara was here.

321

<i>Being ironborn.
Leading ironborn.</i>

322

<i>Getting ready to bring us
back to glory.</i>

323

Euron:
<i>And how will she do that?</i>

324

I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

325

Right idea, except I'm the one who's
going to build the Iron Fleet

326

<i>because I'm the one
who knows how to use it.</i>

327

<i>I've been all over the world.</i>

328

I've seen more of it
than all of you combined.

329

And across the sea there is a person

330

who hates the great lords of
Westeros just as much as we do.

331

Someone with a large army,

332

three large dragons, and no husband.

333

<i>I'm going to build that fleet</i>

334

and I'm going to gallivant right over

335

and give it to Daenerys Targaryen

336

- along with my big cock.
- 

337

You're going to seduce
the Dragon Queen?

338

I'm not going to seduce her.
The Iron Fleet will seduce her.

339

And together we're going
to take the Seven Kingdoms.

340

I wasn't born to be king.

341

I paid the iron price

342

and here I stand.

343



344


Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

345

Euron! Euron!
Euron! Euron!

346

Euron! Euron!

347

May Euron, your servant,
be born again

348

from the sea as you were.

349

<i>Bless him with salt.
Bless him with stone.</i>

350

<i>Bless him with steel.</i>

351

<i>Listen to the waves.
Listen to the god.</i>

352

<i>He is speaking to us and he says</i>

353

<i>we shall have no king
but Euron Greyjoy.</i>

354

Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

355

<i>Let the old Euron drown.</i>

356

<i>Let his lungs fill with seawater.</i>

357

<i>Let the fish eat
the scales off his eyes.</i>

359

but rises again harder and stronger.

360

What is dead may never die.

All: What is dead may never die.

Where are my niece and nephew?

366

Let's go murder them.

367

Aeron:
<i>They stole our best ships.</i>

368

Won't be enough to save them.

369

Go back to your homes.

370

Chop down every tree you can find.

371

Quarter-saw the timber
and start building.

372

I want every man bending planks.

373

I want every woman
spinning flax for sails.

374

Build me a thousand ships

375

and I will give you this world.

376

I banished you twice.

377

You came back twice.

378

And you saved my life.

379

So I can't take you back

380

and I can't send you away.

381

You must send me away.

382

Is there a cure?

383

I don't know.

384

How long does it take?

385

I don't know that either.

386

But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

387

I'll end things before that.

388

I'm sorry.

389

I'm so sorry.

390

Don't be.

391

All I've ever wanted
was to serve you.

392

Tyrion Lannister was right.

393

I love you.

394

I'll always love you.

395

Good-bye, khaleesi.

396

Do not walk away from your queen,

397

Jorah the Andal.

398

You have not been dismissed.

399

You pledged yourself to me.

400

You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

401

<i>Well, I command you to find the cure</i>

402

<i>wherever it is in this world.</i>

403

I command you to heal yourself

404

<i>and then return to me.</i>

405

When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

406

I need you by my side.

407

In the last fortnight since
our pact with the Masters,

408

how many killings have been carried
out by the Sons of the Harpy?

409

None.

410

And how many Masters have been
butchered by the free men?

411

Two, but that was
the day of the pact.

412

<i>Since then, nothing.</i>

413

So it's safe to say that a
fragile peace has taken hold.

414

For now.

415

For now is the best we
get in our profession.

416

It's not enough.

417

Considering the city was
on the brink of civil war,

418

I'd say it's a good start.

419

It's not enough
for Meereen to have peace.

420

They need to know Daenerys
is responsible for it.

421

The Sons of the Harpy
have a good story.

422

Resist the foreign invaders.

423

Our queen has an even better story.

424

Mother of Dragons, Breaker
of Chains and all that.

425

The people know
who brought them freedom.

426

Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

427

Who brought about
an end to the violence?

428

We need someone the people trust,

429

someone they know cannot
be bought or influenced.

430

Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

431

Who said anything about "him"?

That's about the extent
of my Valyrian.

439

Thank you for travelling
all this way.

440

I know from personal experience how
uncomfortable the journey can be.

441

The truth is we need your help.

442

We had hoped that we could
somehow persuade you to--

443

You don't need to persuade me.

444

I came to help.

445

Daenerys Stormborn is the
one who was promised.

446

From the fire she was
reborn to remake the world.

447

Yes.

448

She has freed the slaves
from their chains

449

and crucified the Masters
for their sins.

450

She did indeed.

451

Her dragons are fire made flesh,

452

a gift from the Lord of Light.

453

But you heard all of this
before, haven't you?

454

On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

455

<i>The dragons will purify
nonbelievers by the thousands,</i>

456

burning their sins and flesh away.

457

Ideally we'd avoid purifying
too many nonbelievers.

458

The Mother of Dragons has followers
of many different faiths.

459

You want your queen to be
worshipped and obeyed.

460

And while she's gone,
you want her advisors

461

to be worshipped and obeyed.

462

I'd settle for obeyed.

463

<i>I will summon
my most eloquent priests.</i>

464

They will spread the word.

465

Daenerys has been sent to lead
the people against the darkness

466

in this war and in the
great war still to come.

467

That sounds most excellent.

468

A man named Stannis
Baratheon was anointed

469

as the chosen one
by one of your priestesses.

470

He, too, had a glorious destiny.

471

He attacked King's Landing
and was soundly defeated

472

by the man standing beside me.

473

Last I had heard,
he had been defeated again,

474

this time at Winterfell
and this time for good.

475

We'd be most grateful for any support
you could provide the queen.

476

I suppose it's hard for a
fanatic to admit a mistake.

477

Isn't that the whole point
of being a fanatic?

478

You're always right.

479

Everything is the Lord's will.

480

Everything is the Lord's will.

481

But men and women make mistakes.

482

Even honest servants of the Lord.

483

And you, an honest
servant of the Lord,

484

why should I trust you
to know any more

485

than the priestess
who counseled Stannis?

486

My friend has a healthy
skepticism of religion,

487

but we are all loyal
supporters of the queen.

488

Everyone is what they are

489

and where they are for a reason.

490

Terrible things happen for a reason.

491

Take what happened to you, Lord
Varys, when you were a child.

492

<i>If not for your mutilation</i>

493

<i>at the hand of
a second-rate sorcerer,</i>

494

<i>you wouldn't be here
helping the Lord's Chosen</i>

495

<i>bring his light into the world.</i>

496

Knowledge has made you powerful.

497

But there's still
so much you don't know.

498

<i>Do you remember
what you heard that night</i>

499

<i>when the sorcerer tossed
your parts in the fire?</i>

500

You heard a voice call out from the flames.
Do you remember?

501

Should I tell you
what the voice said?

502

Should I tell you the name
of the one who spoke?

503

We serve the same queen.

504

If you are her true friend,

505

you have nothing to fear from me.

506



507



508

What?

509



510



511



512

He saw me, the Night King!

513

- <i>He saw me!</i>
- He touched you.

514

I don't know.
He was close, but--

515

He touched you.

516

He knows you are here.
He'll come for you.

517

But he can't get in.

518

He can now.
His mark is on you.

519

You must leave, all of you.

520

Meera: <i>Come on, Hodor.
Help me with the sledge.</i>

521

Hodor.

522

I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

523

- The time has come.
- The time for what?

524

For you to become me.

525

But am I ready?

526

No.

527

We can't defend the north
from the walkers

528

and the south from the Boltons.

529

If we want to survive,
we need Winterfell

530

and to take Winterfell,
we need more men.

531

Davos: <i>Aside from the
Starks and the Boltons,</i>

532

the most powerful houses in the North

533

are the Umbers, the Karstarks,

534

and the Manderlys.

535

The Umbers and the Karstarks

536

have already declared
for the Boltons,

537

so we're not doing so well there.

538

The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

539

But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay

540

without knowing
they had another choice.

541

I beg your pardon, my lady,

542

but they know that a Stark
beheaded their father.

543

I don't think we can
count on them either.

544

How well do you know
the North, Ser Davos?

545

Precious little, my lady.

546

<i>My father always said
Northerners are different.</i>

547

More loyal, more
suspicious of outsiders.

548

They may well be loyal,

549

but how many rose up
against the Boltons

550

when they betrayed your family?

551

I may not know the North,
but I know men.

552

They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

553

and even the bravest of
them don't want to see

554

their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

555

If Jon's going to convince
them to fight alongside him,

556

they need to believe
it's a fight they can win.

557

There are more than three
other houses in the North--

558

Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,

559

<i>Mazin, Hornwood.</i>

560

Two dozen more. Together
they equal all the others.

561

We can start small and build.

562

Sansa:
<i>The North remembers.</i>

563

<i>They remember the Stark name.</i>

564

People will still risk
everything for it,

565

from White Harbor
to Ramsay's own door.

566

I don't doubt it.

567

But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

568

No, but I do.

569

Jon is every bit
as much Ned Stark's son

570

as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

571

<i>And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,</i>

572

<i>but they will back us against
the Boltons without question.</i>

573

I didn't know the Tullys
still had an army.

574

My uncle the Blackfish
has reformed it

575

and retaken Riverrun.

576

How do you know that?

577

Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

578

That's good.

579

The Blackfish is a legend.

580

His support would mean a great deal.

581

Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

582

almost starts to look
like a winning side.

583

I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

584

You heard them.
We need more men

585

and my uncle has an army.

586

We can send the Blackfish a raven.

587

Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.

588

It has to be you.

589

Ride for Riverrun.
My uncle will talk to you

590

and you'll know how to talk to him.

591

What is it?

592

I don't like leaving you here alone.

593

With Jon?

594

Not him.
He seems trustworthy.

595

A bit brooding, perhaps.

596

I suppose that's
understandable, considering.

597

The others, though.

598

Davos and the Red Woman helped
a man murder his own brother

599

with bloodmagic.

600

<i>And when Stannis paid for
his crime, where were they?</i>

601

Already out looking for a
leader with better prospects.

602

And that wildling fellow
with the beard--

603

Jon isn't Tormund. Jon
isn't Davos, the Red Woman

604

or Stannis for that matter.
Jon is Jon.

605

He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
I trust him.

606

Then why did you lie to him when he asked
you how you learned about Riverrun?

607

New dress?

608

I made it myself.
Do you like it?

609

Yeah, it's--
I like the wolf bit.

610

Good, because I made this for you.

611

<i>I made it like the one
Father used to wear.</i>

612

As near as I can remember.

613

Thank you, Sansa.

614

You're welcome.

615

Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

616

I'll do my best.

617

Good luck.

618

Should we close the gate,
Lord Commander?

619

I'm not
the Lord Comman--

620

yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate.

621

Meera:
<i>We can go home now, Hodor.</i>

Well, maybe not home home,

624

but somewhere that isn't a cave.

625


Hodor.

626

Eat something that isn't moss.

627

I want an egg.
How do you like 'em?

628

Boiled? Fried up
with some butter?

629


Hodor.

630

With a rasher of bacon
and some blood sausage.

647

Comport yourself
with dignity at the Vale

648
